25.82849034,yes,no,1456,44435,390,14,0,0,I agree with lymepool.  My son and I have the same problem.  Had tilt table test way before our lyme diagnosis and found this problem after major symptoms. He is a competative swimmer  and sometimes  he would pass out while doing flip turns. No sign of a problem before the turn! It would also happen when kneeling as an alter server at church. <br/>  <br/> We take electrolyte mix or  emergen C  with water.  Water straight seems to deplete the balence in us with lyme.  Some of us who have lyme affecting the vagus nerve have these low blood pressure problems that were mentioned by lymepool and CAPA.  This took me 4 years to work out after seening the best pediatric specialists in NYC  Columbia U.  and olympic team MD's etc. <br/>  <br/> Interesting that lyme was never brought up by them  and interesting that Columbia U. doesn't share their info between specialists...as we have now been to Columbia U. for lyme type tests/ treatments sent by our LLMD. <br/>  <br/> No one  except our good llmd's are connecting the dots. <br/>  <br/> Also  NOW&lt; we have not been having any symptoms that we had before.  We finally have also addressed the mal-absorption issue.  Please work with someone who understands nutrition and how lyme patients do not absorb nutrients correctly.  We supplement with liquid shakes  off and on  containing amino acids  electrrolytes  etc.  Our own combo for endurance and balance. <br/>  <br/> LP <br/>  <br/> Good results.,20,18,0.048582996,Experimental,Experimental

People are suffering and dying from Lyme disease. We are fighting a battle to spread the word and have this disease be taken seriously and here it is being turned into a joke. Shame on you. If you want to see a real film on lyme disease see  under our skin  and lets see how funny you think lyme disease is then.  <br/>  <br/>  Much like the time period and the setting  Lyme disease plays a fairly significant role in certain aspects of the story  but Lymelife isn?t a film about a disease any more than it?s a film about the 70?s or Long Island. The real story is about Scott  his family and the Bragg family and what they?re going through. In that respect  the film has a certain timeless quality that I think will make it relatable to most audiences.  <br/>  <br/>  The difference is Steve that the film isn't called seventieslife  longIslandlife  it is called  lymelife.  You may not realize it  but it is a slap in the face to those of us suffering from Lyme disease. <br/>  <br/> Sincerely  <br/>     Ann Ehlers,64,20,0.04245283,Experimental,Experimental

In vitro (checkerboard technique; B. burgdorferi strain B31; modified BSK II medium) it was found that while roxithromycin showed excellent efficacy against B. burgdorferi (MIC 0.031 mg/l)  co-trimoxazole had no effect.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> However  the combination of both chemotherapeutics led to a minor synergistic effect  decreasing the MIC for roxithromycin by one dilution step at concentrations of co-trimoxazole from 256 to 8 mg/l. In addition  a clearly reduced growth of microorganisms was seen at concentrations of roxithromycin as low as 0.015 mg/l in combination with 256 to 4 mg/l co-trimoxazole  when compared to the positive controls. Most interestingly  however  the motility of B. burgdorferi was markedly reduced even when the two drugs were combined at very low concentrations.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> In an in vivo  non-randomised  open  prospective pilot study it was found that of 17 patients with confirmed late Lyme borreliosis (stage II/III)  treated with combined roxithromycin (300 mg b.i.d.) and co-trimoxazole for 5 weeks  13 (76%) recovered completely by the end of treatment  and four continued to have symptoms on follow-up at 6 and 12 months. This success rate is similar to that seen with i.v. penicillin and ceftriaxone. It appears that the reduced motility of B. burgdorferi makes the pathogen more accessible to the immune system. <br/> offshore-pharma.com/cat--Macrolide--Macrolide.html <br/> PMID: 7782115 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE,22,18,0.04842615,Experimental,Experimental
74.79798532,yes,no,2707,59735,974,24,1,0,Vitamin B12 is a little bit different from other vitamins. If you don't have a certain substance in your digestive system  you can't absorb vitamin B12! <br/>  <br/> Your stomach produces a substance called intrinsic factor. This substance has to be in the intestinal tract in pretty large amounts for your body to be able to absorb vitamin B12. If you don't have  intrinsic factor in your digestive tract   you'll eventually develop a vitamin B12 deficiency called pernicious anemia. <br/>  <br/> Liver is probably the number one source for vitamin B12 -- but any and all animal foods contain this vitamin.  <br/>  <br/> In fact  people who don't eat meat or animal products (like vegetarians and vegans) are some of the folks at highest risk for pernicious anemia.  <br/>  <br/> But just because you eat meat doesn't mean you're safe from a vitamin B12 deficiency;  some people are just born without the intrinsic factor in their digestive systems . Just because you ingest the vitamin doesn't mean you'll be able to absorb and use it. <br/>  Maybe me? or lost the ability?  <br/>  <br/> So what does vitamin B12 do for you? This is a vitamin that is useful in fighting all kinds of diseases at all stages of life. <br/>  <br/> Children with  asthma may benefit from vitamin B12 therapy.  Studies show that daily oral supplements or weekly injections can reduce the frequency episodes of breathing difficulty. <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  Vitamin B12 helps your body produce melatonin  -- the hormone that helps you get a good night's sleep. <br/>  Expains my sleeping better  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Vitamin B12 can help  increase sperm counts  in some men. look out honey haha  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> People with tinnitus  (ringing in the ears)  are often deficient in vitamin B12. Adding a supplement can help diminish the sensation of ringing.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> In laboratory tests   vitamin B12 reduces the replication of HIV (wonder if it inhibits Bb? . AIDS patients often are low in vitamin B12. Is there a connection? Studies are underway. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Older adults with declining mental function -- even the start of  Alzheimer's disease -- find that vitamin B12 can help improve mental clarity. My mind deffinatley cleared some  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> In older adults  vitamin B12 can help work with the brain to produce serotonin -- a neurotransmitter that helps maintain a  calm feeling of well-being.

Then I would go back on  and within a few days it would be awful again. <br/>  <br/> On the bright side  however  in the end I think flagyl combined with zith was responsible for clearing most of my early neuro-brain symptoms. But it was also the beginning of my gut woes.  So  as I'm sure you know  be extra vigilant about your gut while on it.  Looking back  I think I would have done better pulsing it on 1-2 week per month or per every-six-weeks schedule.

What a furor it created! <br/>  <br/> Since then  I have been interviewed by several newspapers  magazines  and appeared on radio talk shows -- all to talk about salt. Who knew it was such a big deal? But since it is  it seems worthwhile to revisit the subject again in more detail. <br/>  <br/> The primary issue that got lost by the AMA is that not all sources of sodium and salt are the same. As far as the body is concerned  there is no connection between the chemically-cleansed sodium chloride table salt you buy in the supermarket (which is also added to virtually every processed food you buy) and the mineral rich organic unrefined sea salt available in health food stores.

301.005766,no,no,6738,146397,914,0,0,1,Jimmy Duarte  gifted musician  charismatic islander  dies at 70  <br/>  <br/> BY MARY LANCASTER INDEPENDENT WRITER  <br/>  <br/> He was a true inspiration to countless young and budding island musicians  serving both as an artistic mentor and an example of the joys of performing. A warm and generous man beloved by all who knew him  James  Jimmy  Duarte's signature nod and sincere smile will be missed by those mourning his passing. Mr. Duarte died peacefully at home on Saturday morning  May 5  2007 at the age of 70.  <br/>  <br/>   <br/> ROB BENCHLEY FILE  When he talked to you he had a way of making you feel special. Jimmy had that special ability to get to your heart   said friend Nick Ferrantella of Jimmy Duarte.   <br/>   <br/>  He loved this town. He was a real Nantucketer through and through   said his wife of 46 years  Jean Duarte  who explained that her husband experienced heart problems in the last few years that had developed from Lyme disease.  He loved music and he loved sports - anything with kids - the kids and music. I have never heard him say he didn't like someone. That's just the way he was. I was lucky I found someone like that.   <br/>  <br/> James A. Duarte was born on Nantucket to James L. Duarte  a Cape Verdean  and Minnie (Correia) Duarte  an island native. His talent blossomed in his youth  and Mr. Duarte began playing the guitar and singing at 14. An accomplished songwriter and versatile musician who mastered styles from blues to rock and jazz  he shared his creativity freely with many teens wanting to hone their abilities and begin their own bands.  <br/>  <br/>   <br/> PHOTO COURTESY OF VAUGHAN MACHADO At 30 Acres are  from left  David Perry on guitar  John Gebo on drums  Shelby  Biffy  Campbell on bass  and Jimmy Duarte on guitar.   <br/>   <br/>  I could talk about Jim Duarte for a long time   said Vaughan Machado.  He was my first guitar idol. When I was 11 years old and I got my first guitar for Christmas I didn't know how to tune it. My father called him and Jimmy invited me to his house late Christmas morning and helped me tune it. When I went to his house he was playing an electric guitar and it was at that moment I was inspired. I went on to play professionally and it started with that day in his kitchen. As a performer  he was a pioneer here. There is no doubt that he influenced every one of my generation on Nantucket in terms of playing and performing. He was a sweet man and definitely one of the nicest  well-liked men on Nantucket.   <br/>  <br/> Nick Ferrantella was another young musician who admired Mr. Duarte's talent and was fortunate to be invited to play with him as a teenager and in his early 20s. He especially recalls an entire summer he played drums with Mr. Duarte's  Jimmy D and the Acres  group at 30 Acres off Bartlett Road  the island's original rhythm and blues and rock and roll club.  <br/>  <br/>  But Jimmy had a lot of bands   said Ferrantella.  Everybody who was young and local played with one of his combinations at one time or another. Musically  he was special. He was like a song stylist with a Cape Verdean flavor that was unique to himself. He had that smooth  tasty thing going - that warm sort of thing was what made him so unique. And he always had that handsome Muhammed Ali smile. When he talked to you he had a way of making you feel special. Jimmy had that special ability to get to your heart. Like everybody  I'm going to miss him. He had a lot of fans and friends.   <br/>  <br/> Ferrantella and other musicians including Bob VanArsdale  George Gardos and Mr. Duarte's cousin  David Perry  recorded Mr. Duarte's popular song  Darlin'  on a soundtrack named  Last Call  created separately from the video documentary of that name about the island's former Main Street bar The Bosun's Locker. Inside the CD envelope they thanked Mr. Duarte for allowing them to reproduce his work.  <br/>  <br/>  You'd never find a sweeter guy   said Perry  who was just a small child when he first heard Mr. Duarte play.  Jimmy was actually my first guitar hero. A lot of what I first learned and my taste developed from what he was doing. He was one of the first guys I knew who was playing music when it started to become rock and roll  and that's what we wanted to be doing. He was the man for the rock and roll stuff.   <br/>  <br/> Perry  like other young people  was honored to be invited to be in one of Mr. Duarte's bands when Perry was just 14  making the rounds from 30 Acres to the Chicken Box and at private parties and events  and later being part of his other groups. Some of them were the Jimmy Duarte Combo  the 30 Acres Combo  Jimmy D and the Acres and The Islanders.  <br/>  <br/>  He was an influence to many and played with the musicians who were around and up and coming from the late '50s through a couple years ago   said Perry.  I don't think there is anyone around here dabbling or whatever who didn't play with Jimmy at one point.   <br/>  <br/> Dennis Liadis performed with Mr. Duarte in The Islanders for five years.  <br/>  <br/>  Those were probably the best five years I've ever had  music-wise. We really had a good thing going   said Liadis.  He was an unbelievable guitar player - one of the best I've ever seen. There wasn't anything he couldn't play.   <br/>  <br/> Though Mr. Duarte is well-known for his music  he was also a dedicated Nantucket Boys Club football coach for many years and one of the original founders of the Nantucket Little League. In addition  Mr. Duarte was a town employee for more than three decades  first with the police department and then for about 25 years with the Department of Public Works. He began with the DPW as an equipment operator and was general foreman when he retired a half-dozen years ago.  <br/>  <br/>  He was a wonderful man   said DPW administrator Diane Holdgate  who worked with Mr. Duarte for 15 years.  He was like a surrogate father to all the guys here. Everybody loved him.   <br/>  <br/> Mr. Duarte was predeceased by his parents and a brother  Franklin Duarte of Dorcester. He leaves his wife  Jean  son  Nick  daughter-in-law  Jana  granddaughter  Kezia  10  and grandson  Darian  5  all of Nantucket. He also leaves sisters Frances Barros of Wareham and Paula Sherwood of Gloucester  brother Paul Duarte of Buzzards Bay  and many cousins.  <br/>  <br/> A wake will be held at the Lewis Funeral Home on Thurs.  May 10 from 5 to 8 p.m. A funeral Mass will be held at St. Mary's Church on Fri.  May 11  at 11 a.m. followed by a reception at Faregrounds Restaurant.  <br/>  <br/> In lieu of flowers  donations in Mr. Duarte's name may be given to the Nantucket Boys and Girls Club or to the Marla Lamb Fund through Nantucket Cottage Hospital.,1,27,0.034825871,Experimental,Experimental

They're putting up signs that mention the name  Trish.   <br/>  <br/> In Pell Lake  the front of one woman's property has more ribbons than others in her neighborhood. That's because  to 41-year-old Lisa Hilton  these ribbons are important. <br/>  <br/> On Friday  Hilton said the ribbons are part of The Trish Project: Ribbons Across America  a program tied into May being the state's Lyme disease awareness month.  <br/>  <br/> This is a personal endeavor for Hilton  who has been struggling with Lyme disease for the past 18 years.  <br/>  <br/> It is a painful  controversial disease. <br/>  <br/>  I've been diagnosed with tons of stuff  (but) I would get lost sometimes while I was driving   Hilton said.  My arms  my legs would sometimes go numb. I don't drive because of this. Sometimes  I just felt like I couldn't get out of bed (or) move my arms.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>    <br/> According to Hilton  the identification and treatment of Lyme disease is mired in red tape. Currently  there's a bill at the House of Representatives level to change the way people are tested for the disease and the treatment. <br/>  <br/> She said doctors are not allowed to treat Lyme with long-term antibiotics. <br/>  <br/>  It's funny because you can treat acne with long-term antibiotics  but you can't treat Lyme disease   Hilton said. <br/>  <br/> Also  the reliability of the tests used to diagnose Lyme disease is in question. What's worse  symptoms of Lyme disease mirror those of other afflictions. <br/>  <br/>  If you get bit by a tick  whether you get a bulls-eye rash or not  (if) you get treated right away  you have a chance of treating it   Hilton said. <br/>  <br/>   <br/> For her  that wasn't the case. A doctor finally determined Hilton had Lyme disease after she suffered with her symptoms for about 15 years. <br/>  <br/>  I was diagnosed so late that I don't think I'll ever get better   she said. <br/>  <br/> Few doctors are Lyme savvy  Hilton said. Her doctor practices in Fond du Lac.  <br/>  <br/> The nature of the disease makes her bad days bedridden affairs. <br/>  <br/>  On a good day  I can go to Wal-Mart or something   she said.  <br/>  <br/>   <br/> Because Lyme disease is transferred by insects  specifically ticks  someone infected with Lyme disease also is more susceptible to other diseases. <br/>  <br/>  But everybody is different   Hilton said.  You could be a carrier for years and years before it comes out.  <br/>  <br/> For her  it started with panic attacks and increased anxiety. Her joints grew stiffer. She experienced bouts of confusion.  <br/>  <br/> Hilton said Lyme disease can lead to clinical depression.  <br/>  <br/>  They say that's the biggest overlooked symptom on the psychiatric side of it   she said. <br/>  <br/> Ribbons <br/>  <br/> The goal of The Trish Project is to use lime green ribbons to make people ask questions. So far  people have tied them in several locations throughout Elkhorn  Lake Geneva  Pell Lake  Genoa City and Linn Townships.  <br/>  <br/> Hilton said some places that have displayed ribbons include the Pell Lake Mobil  where she worked with her husband  Jason; the Genoa City Retirement Home  another place she used to work; and Genoa City Foods. <br/>  <br/> She said other people are tying these ribbons. <br/>  <br/> That's encouraging to Hilton  who hopes more people know about the difficulties people with Lyme disease face. <br/>  <br/> Eventually  she hopes the chances of cutting through the red tape preventing better testing methods and treatment improve the more people know about Lyme disease. <br/>  <br/>  If I could save one person  if one mom looks down and sees a tick on their kid  pulls it off and notices the bite right away  I've saved a life   Hilton said. <br/>  <br/> LYME DISEASE FACTS According to information reported in 2005 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: n Lyme disease is spread through tick bites. A tick must be attached to a person's skin for about 24 hours before it transmits the bacterium that causes the disease. The bite is usually painless  which makes it difficult to detect. n Wisconsin is one of 12 states that account for 95 percent of the nation's Lyme disease cases. n The illness usually occurs during the summer months and often  but not always  starts as a roughly circular reddish rash around or near the tick bite. n That rash expands over a period of days or weeks  often from 4 to 12 inches in diameter or larger. During the rash stage  symptoms including fever  headache  fatigue  stiff neck  muscle and joint pain may be present. n If left untreated  within a few weeks to months after the rash onset  complications including meningitis  facial palsy  heart abnormalities and arthritis may occur. Swelling and pain in large joints may recur over several months or years in untreated Lyme disease. Not all people with the disease develop the initial skin rash. <br/>  <br/>  <br/>          Reader Feedback SubmissionBefore posting a comment  think about a few things.

It is very clear that much more needs to be known about this disease  including different diagnostic testing  the evolution of the disease and changes in treatment protocols. More than 265 000 cases of Lyme have been reported to the CDC by the end of 2007. <br/>  <br/> My son  now 18  has had Lyme Disease three times. Since December 2006  he has not been himself  in spite of 4 rounds of oral abx and one round of IV abx. While on abx  we never saw real improvement  and within months after coming off  he goes into a significant decline. <br/>  <br/> I recently read several articles that discuss the same thing with the bb bacteria  and that is with certain antibiotics that are recommended for use in the treatment of Lyme  the bacteria mutates itself from the spirochete form  rending it resistant to the antibiotics. This helps explain why my son and others have not responded to the recommended protocol. Now we have to find a doctor who is willing to use a combination of different antibiotics to get rid of Lyme forever. <br/>  <br/> Link to article:  www.guiltedgirls.tripod.com/id25.html ,14,29,0.028708134,Experimental,Experimental

It's just trying to figure out why some have an immune breakdown and go chronic. <br/>  <br/> I know that my LLMD would most likely hold off treatment until symptoms start to show. <br/>  <br/> I had very mild symptoms for years and chalked it up to the epstein barre virus my husband and I had for three years back in the early 90's. <br/>  <br/> Lately  I've had an increase in symptoms like being more fatigued than usual  night seizures  and breathing problems. <br/>  <br/> I tested negative for all lyme and co-infections  but the doctor put me on six months of zithromax.  At the end of that time  I took one Rifampin and my head felt like it was going to explode. <br/>  <br/> Had the blood test done again  and  this time tested positive for bartonella and HHV6.  He said a biofilm had formed and then got compromised releasing the bacteria into the blood.  This bacteria can hide in tissues. <br/>  <br/> At this time  I am just doing vitamin D therapy.

Our son's are less glaring  and he's a  complainer  so he's not often believed. <br/>  <br/> I've posted his sx before and the lymenet consensus was to get him to an LLMD asap.  Unfortunately  I was dealing with a huge relapse myself  an ailing 97 year old grandmother for whom I was a primary caregiver (she passed 2 weeks ago)  and a very doubtful husband. <br/>  <br/> My son has 24 of the symptoms on Dr. J's list of 39.  The two most recent and troubling symptoms are 1) uncontollable full upper-body twitches and 2) hiding behavior--almost everyday my son covers himself in a blanket and crawls into tight spaces such as a toy chest.  His other major symptoms are shin and foot pain  headaches  large muscle pains  major neck pain and cracking. <br/>  <br/> And oh by the way  he has had 4 engorged tick bites  two on the head  one on the penis and one in the armpit (the last one which resulted in an em rash  lyme dx and 6 weeks amox tx in 05). <br/>  <br/> My problem in a nutshell:  DH thinks that DS's symptoms are imagined  that it's all BS  that he doesn't want to spend the $  that he thinks I AM MAKING THE KID SICK WITH MY SUGGESTING SYMPTOMS!!! <br/>  <br/> Basically  DH is in denial.  He's has had multiple tick bites  major back pain  neck pain  head aches  bottom of the foot pain  fatigue and short-term memory loss.  He refuses to even discuss.  Says sure he's probably lyme positive  but his immune system is dealing with it fine. <br/>  <br/> My son wants to go to the Dr.  When he complains to me about a new sx I try to get him to tell his father but he tells me  dad just doesn't get it .

While you're praying and while they are in denial  don't depend on them for your support or for your son's support. <br/>  <br/> We've (myself  wife and daughter) have become our own support group.  We love our extended family  but we don't depend on them for our daughter's mental well-being. <br/>  <br/> She doesn't understand people  why they can't be more empathetic toward her illness.  I know that one day they will be the ones who will have missed out on her love  once she's recovered from this illness. <br/>  <br/> Again  all I can say is pray for them.  It's terrible to say but I don't think the general public will ever understand the suffering of Lyme patients until someone famous dies from it (Rock Hudson - AIDS)  etc. <br/>  <br/> It's going to have to become fashionable before we'll get the help we need to fight this battle  before we get the research dollars  the health insurance money or the doctor's understanding. <br/>  <br/> Try to keep the faith.

601.7871524,yes,no,2311,94388,2,0,0,0,Hi all- <br/>  <br/> I thought I would post a general message to introduce myself in order to get acquainted with the forum & members. <br/>  <br/> For the past three years I have been sick  on and off. I lost a lot of time at work and in college. I was either told I had the flu and sent home. Sometimes I 'might' have this or that  and was prescribed antibiotics (which never did anything). I'd get so sick at times that getting out of bed was impossible. This past year has been the worst of the worst. I've had approximately eight ED visits - never with an outcome. Three of those visits were with in a month span by ambulance because I could not ambulate without excruciating pain  became photo- phobic & stiff with tremors. I even experienced what was diagnosed as a 'drop down' seizure  in which I recollect nothing  without any hx. of seizures. Symptoms such as; on & off fevers  severe joint pain (limbs  shins  toes  ankles  elbows  fingers  neck)  insomnia  lethargy  photo-phobia  tremors  sore throats on & off  dehydration  blurry vision  severe short term memory problems  exacerbation of psychiatric issues (depression & anxiety)  seizures  migranes  salvation  weight gain & loss  many cognitive difficulties & more odd symptoms I could rattle off to you all. I was never diagnosed - always told i had a 'potential' seizure or i was dehydrated. Sometimes the ED MD's looked at me like I was a pain medication seeker. This has all been very frustrating.  <br/>  <br/> I was seeing a pediatrician  whom I just had to leave due to being much too old for him anymore - who specialized in infectious disease. I was given many upon many blood tests. Lyme tests always came back negative. I saw an allergist & immunologist - all testing normal as could be. Finally it has become quite obvious my symptoms are that of Lyme disease & not of any of the many diagnosis' I had received through specialty docs. I'm now playing the waiting game. My apt. is only two weeks away with a Lyme specialist & I am almost excited. It seems I am having more bad days or 'flare ups' than good days...& I feel as if I am going crazy at times.  <br/>  <br/> So  that is my story in [very] short. Thanks to someone my mother met  I have found this site and am grateful. It feels awful lonely lately. <br/>  <br/> -agrace.,11,36,0.024038462,Experimental,Experimental

I've never read that borrelia is macroscopic.   <br/>  <br/> Whatever pathogens he found on the video do not look like borrelia so we are probably not looking at the same thing. <br/>  <br/> I feel pretty certain that borrelia cannot be seen with the naked eye and I'm sure mainstream science would agree as would no doubt Burgdorferi.   <br/>  <br/> If we were able to see them with the naked eye or even with a normal microscope  it would be much easier to diagnose lyme disease.  Instead  we must look at antibodies because they are hard to find in blood but also because they are not visible in blood or tissue. <br/>  <br/> It's possible they are the filarial worms that Burgdorferi found accompanies borrelia  I couldn't say because I don't know much about that. <br/>  <br/> Perhaps Gary is finding the parasites that cause morgellans?  Don't know much about morgellan's either but I think someone suggested that the black things that were coming out of his skin might be morgellans. <br/>  <br/> Terry,35,12,0.068062827,Experimental,Experimental

Which is an underpowered version of the bionic 880 or the lumina 900 by heliohealth still be very helpful.  I am interested in the more powerful units. <br/>  <br/> I think in the end we'll find that a combination of light wave frequencies is best.  As long as they are energetically tested specific to the person. <br/>  <br/> Thinking out loud  these are my evalution of frequencies  450nm for about 10 minutes a day over the naval (UV-A).  To do blood irradiation of pathogens.  660nm (630nm is probably better) targets to places of severe pain for inflammation relieve and cell regeneration & repair.  880nm for energetic stimulation of cells as well as regeneration but different then 660nm as well as detoxification.  1072nm used in the helmet for actually killing pathogens directly (this is a guess) based on the use of led helmet so far and research papers I've read.  1072nm for detoxification not sure about cell regeneration or repair.  It might be a good guess it would do neural regeneration. <br/>  <br/> My point is what we are discovering the value of frequencie other then just 880  and like robin123  660nm has been wonderful for my tennis elbow (630nm) is probably better. <br/>  <br/> The question is to figure the best combination and to get practioners savvy enough to energetically test for it.,1279,27,0.031372549,Experimental,Experimental

767.5873562,no,no,4924,93727,1,0,1,0,This article is from Nashuatelegraph.com <br/> Dave Brooks <br/> Published: Wednesday  January 14  2009 <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Red Cross doing blood work using volunteer army of donors <br/> Let's see: The global economy is collapsing  climate change is accelerating  my TV will become useless next month and I've got a hangnail.  <br/>  <br/> Hoo  boy; let's talk about something fun for a change. How about disease-carrying deer ticks! <br/>  <br/> Actually  it isn't the ticks or the disease they transmit (babesiosis  in this case  not Lyme disease) that interests me. Rather  it's the way the Red Cross is using the vast volunteer army of blood donors to hunt down an elusive ailment and see how much of a problem it is.  <br/>  <br/> In buzzword terms  you could call this the crowdsourcing of epidemiology. <br/>  <br/> I encountered this the last time our family gave blood  when the paperwork for donors included an announcement it would be tested for a protozoan parasite called babesia  which cause a disease called babesiosis. <br/>  <br/> (Pause for public service announcement: If you're a healthy adult and don't donate blood at least once a year  shame on you. It's easy  just painful enough to make you feel virtuous and serves a real need. Call the Red Cross right now and find the nearest blood drive; no excuses.) <br/>  <br/> My wife  a veterinarian who deals with tick-borne diseases all the time  noticed the notice and wanted to know more.  <br/>  <br/> So I talked to David Leiby  head of the transmissible disease department for the American Red Cross  who designed the study. <br/>  <br/> Babesiosis  it turns out  isn't too dangerous  although it can produce harmful  malaria-like symptoms in the young  the old and those with weak immune systems. Most people who get infected show no signs at all. <br/>  <br/> Babesiosis has long been endemic in Connecticut  Rhode Island and Long Island  and there are anecdotes about it creeping north past Cape Cod into New Hampshire  particularly near the coast. <br/>  <br/> But most people who are infected don't show any symptoms  so it's hard to say for sure where it is. <br/>  <br/>  If I go to the (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention) and say  'Where is babesia and how often does it occur in New Hampshire?' they don't really know   Leiby said.  Sometimes  with emerging diseases like this  the only recourse is to do the study ourselves.  <br/>  <br/> Why does the Red Cross care? Because  Leiby explained   sometimes this agent (the parasite) gets transmitted by blood transmission.  <br/>  <br/> (Surprisingly  a lot of diseases can't be passed on via blood transmission ? including Lyme disease.) <br/>  <br/> If the babesia parasite is common  then the Red Cross will have to start screening all blood supplies for the protozoa  adding it to the seven or eight other things it screens for. <br/>  <br/> Screening is time-consuming and expensive  however  and first they need to see if it's a real problem. So  they're using blood donors to conduct a study of how many people are infected or who have antibodies showing they were infected in the past. <br/>  <br/> You could hardly ask for a better medical survey. Instead of getting people to answer a questionnaire  the highly suspect basis for much of public health's decision-making  you get actual medical data from people's blood.  <br/>  <br/> It isn't a random population sample  but it's pretty darn close  and while it has issues (if I have antibodies in my blood  was I exposed in New Hampshire or when I visited Nantucket?)  it's still pretty darn good. <br/>  <br/>  A lot of our studies start out as epidemiology  to determine the extent  transmission  spread of disease. Then we assess that data  determine if it is a threat to blood supply   Leiby said. <br/>  <br/> A similar survey process in the past led the Red Cross to screen all blood donations for Charga's disease. <br/>  <br/> Leiby said the Red Cross has been doing babesia surveys around Connecticut for several years  but the possibility of a spread has moved the issue up on the priority list. <br/>  <br/> The study only just began in New Hampshire. <br/>  <br/>  We don't know what we're going to find   he said  so it isn't clear what action the Red Cross will take. One possibility is that blood supplies would be screened for babesiosis only in the Northeast  the nation's  epicenter  for the disease. If so  that would be the first time the Red Cross does blood screening regionally  rather than nationally. <br/>  <br/> It will probably take at least a year before any conclusions are reached  but in the meantime  we all have a chance to add a little bit to the nation's knowledge of its health-care picture.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> In other words: Go donate some blood  will you?  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090114/COLUMNISTS03/301149932/-1/columnists ,4,12,0.070991432,Experimental,Experimental

Kudos on all of the walking you have been doing! <br/>  <br/> Lpkayak  you are welcome to join us.  We focus on what we are able to accomplish in moving our bodies on a regular basis.  Some of us are able to do quite a bit (Lymetoo walking a mile) and some of us are hall walking.  <br/>  <br/> We have used pedometers in the past to gauge how much we are moving.  I am sure a professional trainer would get a chuckle from our posts.  But the thought is use-it-or-lose-it.  So we focus on what we can accomplish and try to increase it slowly as we heal.  And celebrate every little accomplishment  because they are important with when dealing with this!  Hope all of that makes sense. <br/>  <br/> I put my garden clothes on yesterday only to receive a phone call saying that my father was headed to the ER.  So I did a lot of hospital chair sitting yesterday.  And it won't be much different today. <br/>  <br/> Have a good one everybody! <br/> Karen,23,16,0.053398058,Experimental,Experimental

A   couple of guys  might have meant girls  or also included girls. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Even 35 years ago  when I began college   I called everyone my age   guys  regardless of their gender. <br/>  <br/> But  I'd hang out with guys and girls late and thought nothing of it.  I learned a lot in those late night talks - but mostly about others' fields of study  their home towns  etc.  It was wonderful. <br/>  <br/> My sense of timing was all off and I did set a (very bad) pattern of late nights - mostly studying - but a little laughter.    <br/>  <br/>  <br/> She will soon learn to monitor her sleep schedule and where her energy goes.  The first weeks of college everything is a bit like Disney World - topsy turvy.    <br/>  <br/> Hopefully  once the adrenaline has subsided a bit her studies will capture her interest and she will settle into a balanced social network. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> - <br/>   <br/>   [ 04.

Also undergoing certification in natural trimming (hooves) and certification in resistance free training.  I have guided in wilderness areas and consulted (prior to retirement and re-entering school I was a small business development consultant) to equine establishments.   <br/>  <br/> Costs include (find out local dollar amount from local tack stores and boarding facilities): <br/>  <br/> MAINTENANCE <br/> Boarding - pasture is way healthier and leads to less health/behavior problems than stall boarding.  We stall horses because it makes us feel good  but bad for horses. <br/>  <br/> Lessons - do not skimp on this or listen to folks who say you can teach yourself!  There is a right way to ride and the self taught way to ride.  The self taught way leads to all kinds of injuries and invisible physical problems which lead to behavior problems which lead to a very unhappy situation you pay lots of money to be in! <br/>  <br/> Trimming feet every 4 - 8 weeks <br/>  <br/> Shoes if required (get one that doesn't need them  but budget for them 'cuz could change) <br/>  <br/> Fecal tests for worms 2 + times a year - don't listen to folks who tell you to skip this and just worm regularly.  Wormers are neurotoxins and should be used only as needed <br/>  <br/> Worming up to 4 times a year - may not be required  but budget for it as changes year to year and facility to facility <br/>  <br/> Shots 1 - 2 times a year depending on region <br/>  <br/> Equine dentist annually - don't listen to those who tell you to skip it. <br/>  <br/> MINIMUM EQUIPMENT <br/> Saddle <br/>  <br/> Saddle pads <br/>  <br/> Bridle <br/>  <br/> Halter <br/>  <br/> Lead rope <br/>  <br/> Blanket <br/>  <br/> Rain sheet <br/>  <br/> Fly sheet  <br/>  <br/> Fly mask <br/>  <br/> Lunge line and whip <br/>  <br/> Riders Helmet <br/>  <br/> Riders Paddock boots <br/>  <br/> Grooming supplies <br/>  <br/> First aid supplies <br/>  <br/> A million other small things - though most of the items in this category are wanted rather than needed.  <br/>  <br/> CONSUMABLES <br/> Fly spray <br/>  <br/> First aid treatments <br/>  <br/> Supplements (most boarding facilities require you to provide your own) <br/>  <br/> I strongly suggest not buying a horse right off.  Start with lessons and volunteering at an equine therapy center.  If she isn't interested enough to keep up with this  she isn't interested enough.  Graduate to a part lease or share-board situation.  Only then move to ownership. <br/>  <br/> Find a barn where the riders are required to learn to tack up and otherwise care for their horse. <br/>  <br/> Find a barn where ground work is as important as riding work.  Most problems start on the ground.  If the barn is so behind the times they will allow bad ground manners and not expect a rider to know how to rectify  or worse are willing to put a rider on a horse with so little respect for people he has bad ground manners  it is an accident - or death - waiting to happen. <br/>  <br/> As far as common knowledge goes... there is a lot more common than there is actual knowledge when it comes to horses!!! <br/>  <br/> Dara,11,7,0.119377163,Experimental,Experimental

My friends husband had recently come home from hunting in northern FL. I slept in the room that had all his hunting apparel and equipment. <br/>  <br/> My Dr. insisted that my symptoms were not from lyme but his intern drew 2 different pictures of bullseyes and asked my mother which one she remember me having.  She picked the one that was constitant with lyme.  The dr.s left the room  had a meeting and reluctantly my Dr. said he would treat me.  (Thanks to the intern) <br/>  <br/> He put me on Doxycycl hyc 100mg cap for 30 days and said that should kill it if I have it in my system.  I told him I wanted to be tested using the IgeneX lab.  I paid $450.00to have the Western Blot done at IgeneX in CA.   <br/>  <br/> These are my results: <br/> 18 KD (IGG) Band (REACTIVE) <br/> 41 KD (IGG) Band (REACTIVE) <br/>  <br/> 23 KD (IGM) Band (REACTIVE) <br/> 31 kDa (IGM)     (IND) <br/> 39 kDa (IGM)     (IND) <br/> 41 kDa (IGM)     (+) <br/>  <br/> I had this test done Oct 2008.  Even though these show positive  my Dr. insists that I dont have Lyme.   <br/>  <br/> Meds Im on now are  <br/> Thyrolar(hypothyroidism started in 2007 after my son was born).   <br/> Adderall XR (20mg 2 x's a day) for about 5 years And recently Cymbalta (30 then 60mg for depression)  <br/> If I didnt have the Adderall to speed me up  I wouldnt be able to function.  Recently I had to switch from the Adderall XR to generic Adderall because of price. I started feeling naucious and took myself off both the Adderall and Cymbalta.  <br/> Although I am taking an Adderall sometimes when I have no energy at all.   <br/> Im 37 5'8 200 lbs (Nov.08 had miscarrage and gained 20 lbs and it hasnt come off).

I also rearranged some of the supplements I was already taking into the KPU protocol--I only had to add Manganese and increase zinc a notch or two. <br/>  <br/> I'm taking the 5 methylation factors  which help with detoxing  and chlorella.  I also took some intestinal detox  but had no major action from that.  <br/>  <br/> I have suddenly been wanting to do a gall stone cleanse  but now will wait until I'm done with this two weeks of drops. <br/>  <br/> This test came back with 11 unidentified or unrecognized substances as reacting. <br/>  <br/> The only biological test I did--as Herr Grundmeyer asked for any test that related to Lyme  which he said was now gone--was CD 57.  It went from 36 (where it had stayed for over a year) to 48--a 33% increase. <br/>  <br/> Having better days now. <br/>  <br/> Best  <br/>  <br/> Cass A,724,8,0.097297297,Experimental,Experimental

You might as well know the whole picture so that you can know all the options for recovering his health. <br/>  <br/> There are 2 kinds of sleep apnea.  Obstructive and Cenral.  Central sleep apnea has nothing to do with the shape of the throat etc..   I'm fairly certain that the ENT cannot tell the liklihood of central sleep apnea with a physical exam.    <br/>  <br/> If he has sleep apnea  there are other options besides a CPAP for treatment depending on the type of apnea that one has.  Meds  appliances made by a dentist  surgery and maybe others. <br/>  <br/> It's possible to  have both sleep apnea and lyme.  I have both as do 2 of my 3 siblings. So many people with lyme disease have throat issues that I think it's possible that a higher percentage of lyme patients have sleep apnea. <br/>  <br/> Terry <br/> I'm not a doctor.,12,16,0.052325581,Experimental,Experimental

YES I laughed all the way out the office! <br/>  <br/> Even though I tested positive with CDC 2xs  her treatment was a joke. Plus she didn't want to treat me the second time! Only cause my test came back a high positive!  <br/>  <br/> Than in her own nice little way told me she couldn't do no more for me. Even though I was testing a high positive on the test she gave me for the 3th time! <br/>  <br/> She was scared of me! She didn't know what to do about my lyme disease and how far gone it was! <br/>  <br/> But I do have a great LLMD now.

In nature  sheep are the most likely hosts for B. melophagi and transmission among sheep is thought to occur via a wingless fly known as a ked. The route(s) of transmission to humans is unknown. <br/>  <br/> Their results are published in the January edition of Emerging Infectious Diseases. <br/>  <br/> The blood samples Breitschwerdt and Maggi tested came from previously healthy women who were suffering from symptoms including muscle fatigue and weakness. One of the patients had been diagnosed with pericarditis  an inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart. B. melophagi was present in blood samples from both women; Bartonella henselae  a strain of the bacterium which has been associated with human neurological illnesses and fatigue  was isolated from one of the samples. <br/>  <br/> The research marks the first time that this particular strain of Bartonella has been cultured from human blood and associated with human illness. <br/>  <br/>  Over the past decade  there has been a rapid expansion in the number of Bartonella species that are documented human pathogens   Breitschwerdt says.  From this preliminary data  it looks as though we may be able to add another species to that list.  <br/>  <br/>  A small number of Bartonella in the bloodstream can cause infection  and this fact  coupled with the large variety of transmission routes by which people can become infected  make the diagnosis  treatment and prevention of the illnesses caused by this bacteria a real challenge   Maggi adds.  I think it's critical that we discover more about how this bacteria infects people  and how Bartonella infection relates to the subsequent development of progressive illnesses in humans. ,3,15,0.056847545,Experimental,Experimental

Did vision quests. I came a long way with it. <br/>  <br/> But still--when I got hit with Lyme  I could feel the burden of the lowered PTSD that I still had  as well. <br/>  <br/> I felt this PTSD burden on my shoulders  and also felt the burden of Lyme on my shoulders: locked shoulder  severe muscle pain at neck-shoulders-in head.  <br/>  <br/> I went to see a psychologist who does EMDR Level 2 for PTSD.  <br/>  <br/> I cherished her. <br/>  <br/> You bring up visuals that plague you. Then the therapist or you do something repetitive  like clap your thighs or whatever  while you speak of it. <br/>  <br/> Then some or all of the fear/memory disappears. How? <br/>  <br/> Know one knows. It's been put forth that possibly the repetition of movement allows the  monkey wrench  in your brain to dissipate or to partly dissipate.  <br/>  <br/> Immediatly the tears flow  for many.  <br/>  <br/> It's been put forth  also  that the monkey wrench then disappears or partly disappears  helping your brain to think faster  thereby stopping the round and round and round and round of PTSD thinking.  <br/>  <br/> That helps you get past it.  <br/>  <br/>  EMDR Level 2 helps you process visuals that hurt and are scary--images--so you can get past it.   <br/>  <br/> No one knows why it works--it just does. It really is a phenomenon. <br/>  <br/> Insurance paid--yup!  <br/>  <br/> Try calling your insurance company and say that you are looking to find a particular psychologist who deals with EMDR Level 2. <br/>  <br/> Took 5 sessions for my PTSD. DId 2 more sessions with her to do affirmations to help me with the horror of chronic Lyme disease.  <br/>  <br/>  I felt fortified!          <br/>  <br/> I still have a little PTSD. I guess you will for the rest of your life.  <br/>  <br/> The VA does not help veterans with PTSD.  <br/>  <br/> They say they do  but I live in a place where everyone is a veteran  most are battle-worn and trust me--the VA does not help veterans with PTSD.  <br/>  <br/> The VA's official excuse is  well  those who get PTSD already had PTSD from their childhood. <br/>  <br/> It's denial--like Lymies are treated. <br/>  <br/> I've heard the military--I forgot which branch--is starting to help troops in Afghanistan and Iraq with PTSD--right away after PTSD happens  by experimenting with EMDR.  <br/>  <br/>  IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME.   <br/>  <br/> Especially  our Iraq soldiers have been hard hit with PTSD. <br/>  <br/> daise    ,14,7,0.118942731,Experimental,Experimental

998.0467652,no,no,2716,95444,114,14,1,0,Hi David <br/>  <br/> It wouldn't really be correct to say that Borrelia  eats tissue  or  eats blood . It parasitises the body by feeding on compounds in our body  including sterols which is unusual in bacteria  but it could get nutrients from blood or from a tissue cell. <br/>  <br/> As for the tick's hemolymph  some scientists believe it is in spiral form within the tick at certain times and in cell wall deficient (L-form) at other times.  <br/>  <br/> I won't pretend to know much about the technical side of setting up a darkfield microscope  but I do know that Mark as an engineer is pretty knowledgeable about that side and I believe he has taken into account all stuff like Brownian motion  appropriate type of lamp etc.. <br/>  <br/> I have witnessed live blood microscopy where you can see a microbe bound across the screen in an unmistakeably purposeful movement. No Brownian motion or coagulated lump of protein could behave that way. <br/>  <br/> I suggest that people have a look at the site of the Danish LLMD Dr Kroun. <br/>  <br/>  http://lymerick.net/videomicroscopy.htm  <br/>  <br/> The videos unfortunately take a long time to load but if you have the computer-power and the patience it is well worth the weight. Some of the borrelia filmed in chronic Lymies' blood has been bound with fluorescent antibody. <br/>  <br/> This is highly specific - no coagulated lump of protein or debris of degenerated red blood cells could bind to specific antibody. <br/>  <br/> Some of the videos there also show the remarkable snake-like movement of what Dr Kroun describes as  pearls on a string .  <br/>  <br/> The modern film findings actually correlate very closely with what early darkfield borreliologists saw in the relapsing fever borrelia  ie the cystic and granular forms and the way they behave. <br/>  <br/> As for the person who says he can't believe a person could have so many spirochetes and still be able to move - in an infection  the numbers of infecting microbes are not the only factor determining how ill a person will be.  <br/>  <br/> Whether the bacteria are active or dormant  whether they are producing toxins  how they affect the cells  where they are in the body  what kind of battle the immune system is waging - all these are factors too. Remember  people can co-exist with a population of microbes for decades (eg varicella zoster - chicken pox) - then suddenly an event like a drop in their immune system can bring the disease back to life  perhaps in a different form (shingles). <br/>  <br/> As for Mark's health  like a lot of chronic Lymies he has had periods of being severely ill  and also periods where he has been more healthy and able to work. <br/>  <br/> Elena,29,15,0.059574468,Experimental,Experimental

With each swallow  it goes into the stomach and on through the intestines. <br/>  <br/> If you catch yeast on the tongue right away  you can often keep it from progressing to the bloating.  Just telling you this for future use.  Check your tongue every morning before you eat or drink from now on to see the status of yeast in your mouth. <br/>  <br/> Burrascano's lyme disease treatment guidelines tell you in detail how to clear it from the mouth  etc. successfully. <br/>  <br/> Check here starting with page 34: <br/>  <br/>  http://www.ilads.org/lyme_disease/B_guidelines_12_17_08.pdf  <br/>  <br/> Also  beyond the yeast issue  you need to find a doc who specializes in the treatment of lyme disease if you ever hope to get well.  This doc will not do.  The low dose doxy will not do the trick  and you can see how her not teaching you how to prevent intestinal yeast has turned out. <br/>  <br/> Please read the entire Burrascano lyme treatment guidelines at the link above and find a lyme doctor who treats per Burrascano guidelines.  Ask  if doc follows Burrascano when you call the lyme doc's office for an appt. <br/>  <br/> I and all my friends and acquaintances have gotten rid of this disease by going to a Burrascano type doc.  Those who try docs who use other protocols generally don't get well  in my experience. <br/>  <br/> The Burrascano guidelines tell you what good lyme disease treatment looks like.  You can compare your treatment to the Guidelines and see for yourself. <br/>  <br/> Here are a few points from Dr. B's guidelines: <br/>  <br/> You must attack both the regular and cyst form of lyme simultaneously--requires 2 different antibiotics to do so.  <br/>  <br/> You must test the patient for all co-infections and other physical ailments (thyroid  etc.) and treat everything the person has. <br/>  <br/> You must treat all co-infections (including mycoplasma  etc.) or the patient will not get well. <br/>  <br/> You must use Igenex for most of these tests--they are a tick-borne disease speciality lab in Calif. <br/>  <br/> You must use very high doses of antibiotics to kill the diseases (batericidal doses). <br/>  <br/> You must give the patient supplements  probiotics  herbs such as artimesinin if babs is suspected  and require adherence to rules such as low carb diet  no alcohol  rest  and exercise as the patient is able to do it. <br/>  <br/> You must treat at least 2 months after all symptoms have disappeared (if sick at least 1 year). <br/>  <br/> These are just a few of the important points you will see in the guidelines. You want a doc who does EVERYTHING Burrascano says to do. He treated lyme for over 25 years  and compiled what he learned so that other docs could benefit from it. Read it in his Guidelines.  <br/>  <br/> Also  a Boston TV station did a great show on lyme disease a few months ago. Here is the link to it:  http://www.kettmann.com/Lyme   <br/>  <br/> When you get to the site  select the link to view the show. The show was taped by a girl on LymeNet and she put it on-line for all of us to be able to view it. You will learn a lot about the medical controversy surrounding lyme disease and why it is so hard to find a doctor who knows how to cure a person of lyme disease. <br/>  <br/> Also  with this disease  you must resign yourself to taking lots of antibiotics.  They are a major part of the treatment.  With a good lyme doc  often you can be finished with treatment in one year.,8,14,0.064421669,Experimental,Experimental

Bush had been treated for Lyme Disease a year after it was announced. <br/>  <br/> Although none of us would wish this disease on another person  I think many of us couldn't help but feel this was going to be some major publicity that we definitely could use. <br/>  <br/> It was swept under the carpet.  There were no details given about his treatment or anything.   <br/>  <br/> Perhaps they researched it enough to know it can mess with our brains and couldn't risk that going out publically.   <br/>  <br/> They surely couldn't keep someone  in power  that was confused.   <br/>  <br/> So then my thought was  perhaps once he's out of office  he will come forward and TALK about it. <br/>  <br/> But realistically  wouldn't people then criticize that he kept this valuable information hidden for so long?   <br/>  <br/> I'm not very optomistic that this will ever be the one that comes to light.  <br/>  <br/>  He may develop another illness due to the unresolved lyme  but I have my doubts it will ever be admitted it could be connected in any way to lyme. <br/>  <br/> Sorry.....just my two cents worth....which obviously isn't worth much.   <br/>  <br/> It would be WONDERFUL though if he WOULD talk. <br/>  <br/> Cathy,47,8,0.1,Experimental,Experimental

This creates an environment the spirochetes do not like. <br/>  <br/> Even though exercise is helpful  your son needs to be sure he doesn't push himself too hard.   <br/> An important part of treatment is adequate rest so the body can heal. <br/>  <br/> Are both of you getting lots of water and  acidophilus?   <br/>  <br/> The antibiotics (abx) kill good bacteria along with the bad  so the good has to be replenished to prevent a systemic yeast infection (candida). <br/> Acidophilus (get it at the health food store) should be taken at least 2 hours after abx so that it has time to help before hitting it again with more abx. <br/>  <br/> Also important to eliminate as much sugar and carbohydrates as possible. <br/>  <br/> If you already know all this.....that's great.,13,10,0.086294416,Experimental,Experimental

1198.675155,no,no,6058,27518,4288,1,7,1,<br/>  <br/> You asked  too  about a doctor of homeopathy.  That would be different than a ND (doctor of naturopathy).   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> However  some NDs do practice homeopathy  along with other modalities.  They may not be licensed in homeoapathy but if they have had training at their ND college  that often suffices for the basics.  Others can go beyond to make homeopathy the sole scope of their practice.   <br/>  <br/> Classical Homeopathy  in my experience  is not a good match for a lyme patient.  Other kinds can help  though. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Many NDs also are L.Ac.s (licensed acupuncturists).  If so  check on their certification.  If an ND is also a L.Ac.  that is a huge bonus to you. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Back to homeopathy: <br/>  <br/> This is just my take on this:  While a specific homeopathic formula may be great right up front when one is out in the woods with a new tick attachment   generally (and in my experience) homeopathy is used as a help to relieve symptoms. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> It is part of an overall plan. <br/>  <br/> There are some doctors or otherwise licensed professionals who are very skilled in homeopathy as their main scope.   Be very careful here to be sure they are educated and degreed by an accredited program. <br/>  <br/> Also  be certain that they are well-read with ILADS research  even if they don't practice that way. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> --------- <br/>  <br/> All the testing is best done with LLMD and through the specialty labs such as Igenex.   Some NDs also know of good labs to test other chronic stealth infections such as Cpn  HHV-6 or mycoplasma. <br/>  <br/> ----------------- <br/>  <br/> There are some excellent LL ND (naturopathic doctors) who are also ILADS members. <br/>  <br/> I would steer clear of anyone who is not ILADS-educated.  Now  that does not mean they can't vary treatment or even rely on herbals when appropriate.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> However  if a ND has not read much of the research (and that is by ILADS authors)  they would be ignorant as to the scope of the problem.    <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I don't know if NDs are licensed in your state.  First  some people who run supplement stores are not licensed NDs.  You really want someone who has been to college plus the four-year naturopathic college and earned a degree. <br/>  <br/> Beyond that  you can find out if they are LL and ILADS-educated. <br/>  <br/> First  ask your LLMD.  Then  email Barbara at ILADS for LL NDs.  (  www.ilads.org  ) <br/>  <br/> You might also inquire at your local support group. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Here are just few links that you can contact to see if they know of anyone in your area (and you can get a sense of what is involved by reading their sites).  Often  LL NDs meet each other at the ILADS conferences. <br/>  <br/> ================= <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  www.dancingviolets.com  <br/>  <br/>  www.dancingviolets.com/media/pdf/LymeDisease.pdf   <br/>  <br/> The author of this site is an ILADS member and has a background in naturopathic medicine.  She has knowledge of the unique nature of the spirochete and what is required but also knows all about supportive techniques. <br/>  <br/> Be sure to read all that she has written.  She is very generous providing this on the web. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ============= <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  www.steveclarknd.com/LymeDisease.htm   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> He  too  has a firm grasp of lyme and is a member of ILADS and a N.D.  The information at this site is very informative. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ============== <br/>  <br/> This may be of interest: <br/>  <br/>  www.lyme-disease-research-database.com/lymenutritionfile1_files/Integrated-Approach-DAN.pdf  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> HEALING LYME DISEASE: An Integrated Approach to Curing Chronic Infection <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ======================= <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  www.naturopathic.org  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> American Association of Naturopathic Physicians <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Promotes professional awareness  while providing consumer information and a searchable database of members. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ================= <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Be sure to ask about a ND's education  degrees  professional affliliations - and then confirm all that.  Often  you can ask for a 5 minute phone conversation.   <br/>  <br/> Beyond that  you may ask what they may charge for 15 - 30 by phone so that you can get a better idea if their expertise would be a good match for you.   By paying for a phone consult of extended time  you can save so much time and money if this is not a good fit.   <br/>  <br/> --------------- <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Ask them if they have treated advanced lyme. Ask them to name a few of their favorite authors in this field. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Have they treated babesia  and  quickly  now they might do that. <br/> Bartonella  Ehrlichia?    <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Have they treated patients with other chronic stealth infections such as mycoplasma (if so  they should know ALL about Garth Nicholson  Ph.D) <br/>  <br/> or Cpn - Chlamydia Pneumonia - see  www.cpnhelp.org   ) <br/>  <br/>  <br/> --- <br/>  <br/> Gong back to lyme  ask if they have read both the ILADS protocol  Burrrancano's and Singleton's book. <br/>  <br/> Ask if they are familiar with Buhner and Zhang. <br/>  <br/> If they don't answer yes to most of these questions  they are probably not very LL. <br/>  <br/> ------ <br/>  <br/> Most NDs  LL or not  are usually excellent with liver support and working with you as an individual.    <br/>  <br/> If there are no LL NDs near you  you may still find one who is not  wierded out  by the complexity of lyme + co. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Seriously  I went to one very expert ND for a separate matter and simply asked if she might be able to work with me as ADJUNCT.  She said that my symptoms really  wierded her out  -  She had never seen anyone so sick with such severe stuff. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> She did  however   direct me to an ILADS-member LL ND in another state. <br/>  <br/> - <br/>   <br/>   [ 05-19-2009  05:36 PM: Message edited by: Keebler ] ,2,6,0.12195122,Experimental,Experimental

That's about the size of a small pea.  I often spread that amount around to three or four parts of my body. <br/>  <br/> So my advice to new people trying bee venom - use a tiny bit and ramp up slowly. <br/>  <br/> I decided to go back on Venex daily  two days ago  after realizing that I'm suddenly a bit achey and fatigued.  I muscle test positive for Venex use.   <br/>  <br/> Could be lyme reappearing after an intense couple of weeks  and loss of lots of sleep.

Some people get better with one/day  some take up to 6/day. <br/>  <br/> IMO  most lyme patients take twice as much zithromax  500mg/day. <br/>  <br/> Sounds like alot of flagyl to me.  Hope others will chime in.  I would not be able to tolerate that on a daily basis  but it is a helpful treatment for many. <br/>  <br/> I believe that zith can hit bart  but more effective bart treatments are rifampin with zith or levaquin.,5,8,0.092592593,Experimental,Experimental

1345.928119,yes,no,5604,29902,742,0,0,0,The Floods and the Symptoms: <br/>  <br/> We had two different floods in our dirt cellar basement  about seven and ten years ago.   <br/>  <br/> Lots of storage got very moldy  and I was never well enough to clean it out.  Just going down there made me feel weak  but I didn't understand why. <br/>  <br/> My husband finally cleaned the basement out about four weeks ago.  This included bringing up boxes of old books with black mold on them  and sorting them in the living room. <br/>  <br/> I freaked out at him for doing this  but still didn't understand the seriousness of it at the time. <br/>  <br/> Now  the health issues are spiraling.  I was about done with any lyme issues AGAIN  and was feeling pretty great.   <br/>  <br/> Suddenly  I have serious body aches  fatigue  brain fog  major irritability  can't sleep  burning skin  bad cough  sores in my nose  and bladder issues  again.  This has not stopped since the basement cleanup. <br/>  <br/> I trust my own muscle testing and reality check  as well as two of my practitioners well enough to know that this is not a lyme recurrance  but my own special reaction to mold and mycotoxins. (Although I fear a lyme rebound with my immune system so compromised!) <br/>  <br/> It's now clear to me that I have been having mold and mycotoxin reactions all along  in addition to lyme.  It may even have been the trigger that allowed lyme to get out of hand  in my case.  It just became acutely clear since the spores came upstairs. <br/>  <br/> I'm posting this especially to warn people in case this sort of thing could be happening to you to  and getting confused with lyme symptoms. <br/>  <br/> Interesting that mold  fungus  yeast  and lyme all create nasty toxins when they die off  and that's what makes people especially ill. <br/>  <br/> ----------------------------------------- <br/> My Kids: <br/>  <br/> I have been trying to figure out my kids issues for years now.  They don't test positive for lyme via blood test or energetic testing  although they have both displayed lyme-type symptoms. <br/>  <br/> One daughter has brain fog  fatigue  muscle aches  a learning disorder  and was a bed-wetter every night until puberty.  Symptoms get better when I run the HEPA air cleaner in her room.  The other little daughter has constant unprovoked irritibility and rage issue.   <br/>  <br/> Both have sores on their feet that have responded to NOTHING except for a mold and fungus homeopathic.   <br/>  <br/> ------------------------------------------- <br/> Solving the Problem: <br/>  <br/> So now  what to do.  I've been hunting this down like a blood hound for the past two weeks. <br/>  <br/> Number one is get rid of the big and obvious mold.  Already done. <br/>  <br/> Next is seal off the basement until further serious examination and remediation can be done. <br/>  <br/> Next  get rid of mold spores and mycotoxins in living area. <br/>  <br/> Finally  get rid of mold and mycotoxins in basement. <br/>  <br/> Finally  finally  deal with issue inside my own body. <br/>  <br/> The question is HOW to get rid of them in the house.  There are varying claims as to the best course of action. <br/>  <br/> Local clean up company says put house under negative pressure (run fans) and vacuum every surface with HEPA vac.  How is this going to clean up my basement problem??? <br/>  <br/> Others say to buy a 1500. HEPA air filter the size of a refrigerator  and run it continually.  Where is this thing going to live in my little house??? <br/>  <br/> Other sources say use ozone shock treatment.  Personal accounts and a naturopath with experience says that this works amazingly well.  Most of the official and government websites I read say this is a hoax and doesn't work. <br/>  <br/> Guess what I'm going to do.  I'm going to trust the same people who helped me well from lyme  and not the official and government web sites.   <br/>  <br/> I'm ordering a 400. professional grade ozone generator  clearing the house of people  plants  froggies  foam rubber items  and anything I am worried about bleaching or decomposing  and bombing the place with O3. <br/> ------------------------------------------ <br/>  <br/> Ozone and Propaganda: <br/>  <br/> This is so weird.  The same craziness about a different illness.  First of all  very little medical recognition that this issue exists.  Then very little understanding or agreement about how to treat it.   <br/>  <br/> Then in addition  well circulated propaganda against anything out of the ordinary when it comes to treatment or remediation.   <br/>  <br/> Most information out there on the web tells you ozone use is a very bad idea.  Yet when I read the actual research of how ozone works  and how it is used industrially  it is used in just such applications.   <br/>  <br/> I think there is so little understanding out there about how this actually works.   <br/>  <br/> I think the mistakes that people make are that they that try to run low level generators while they are in the home  which won't clear out mold  but will make them sick.   <br/>  <br/> Or they try to get rid of heavy mold infestations without manual removal first  and it just doesn't work.   <br/>  <br/> Or else they try to get rid of heavy mold build-up by continually bombing their homes  and end up decomposing all their gaskets and wiring insulation. <br/>  <br/> I'm trying the middle road.  Clear out all the visible mold manually  then zap the remaining spores. <br/>  <br/> I'll let you know how it goes.  Wish me luck  okay. <br/>   <br/>   [ 05-08-2009  11:44 AM: Message edited by: bejoy ] ,56,10,0.082809224,Experimental,Experimental

Here is how to spot and treat it. <br/>  <br/> Excerpts: <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Meet the players <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The opponents in the battle over the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease are the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)  the largest national organization of general infectious disease specialists  (and) <br/>  <br/> and the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS)  an organization made up of physicians from many specialties. (  www.ilads.org  ) <br/>  <br/>  <br/> IDSA maintains that Lyme disease is relatively rare  overdiagnosed  difficult to contract  easy to diagnose through blood testing  and straightforward to treat (  www.journals.uchicago.edu/CID/journal/issues/v43n9/40897/40897.html  - Accessed April 6  2007).  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ILADS  by contrast  asserts that the illness is much more common than reported  underdiagnosed  easier to contract than previously believed  difficult to diagnose through commercial blood tests  and difficult to treat  (especially) <br/>  <br/> especially when treatment is delayed because of commonly encountered diagnostic difficulties (   http://www.ilads.org/guidelines.html   - Accessed April 6  2007). <br/>  <br/> . . .  <br/>  <br/>   . . .To treat Lyme disease for a comparable number of life cycles  treatment would need to last 30 weeks. . . .  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ? . . .Patients with Lyme disease almost always have negative results on standard blood screening tests and have no remarkable findings on physical exam  so they are frequently referred to mental-health professionals for evaluation. <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  ...If all cases were detected and treated in the early stages of Lyme disease  the debate over the diagnosis and treatment of late-stage disease would not be an issue  and devastating rheumatologic  neurologic  and cardiac complications could be avoided...  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> . . . * Clinicians do not realize that the CDC has gone on record as saying the commercial Lyme tests are designed for epidemiologic rather than diagnostic purposes  and a diagnosis should be based on clinical presentation rather than serologic results.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> - Full article at link above  containing MUCH more detailed information. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> -=== <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Co-infections (other tick-borne infections or TBD - tick-borne disease) are not discussed in the Savely article due to space limits.

The pancreas is often overlooked  but it produced many enzymes necessary for digestion.  An impaired gut can be the end result  and taking the strongest probiotic in the world may not be sufficient without addressing all the enzyme deficiencies,26,67,0,Experimental,Experimental

Very weird and scary. However  the yeast meds have returned me to symptoms that I had at the beginning stages of first contracting Lyme. My LLMD said this is great news because the old resilient Lyme have been hiding in the yeast to survive. Now  they have nowhere to hide and that's why I feel horrible right now.

I smelled it to detect odors.. which there were none.. and felt it. Looks  smells and feels like the real thing. <br/>  <br/> You (civilian) can order clothing now.. like what the military folks wear to protect themselves... but it is prettier. It has the tick stuff already in it  so no mess at home doing it yourself. It is for sale at the site below. <br/>  <br/> Also.... Aside from the best protection you can get... it saves money .. as the cans of spray to treat clothing can run from $6 - $8 each.. and only is good for 2 weeks. <br/>  <br/> There is NO scent... so it is good for chemical sensitive folks and hunters in the woods. <br/>  <br/> The site below shows a selection of women?s clothing.. and if you look at the top of the site.. you can click on buttons for men?s and children?s clothing.

1448.170825,yes,no,3136,97639,7,0,0,0,Just really really down lately. Still can't find treatment or a doctor even after switching insurance and the regular MD I picked off the insurance list was a total bomb. I new it wouldn't get me a diagnosis of Bart or anything but it was probably the worst office I've been to yet. disorganized and ineffectual.  <br/>  <br/> Couldn't even get in to see the doc but a PA instead who wouldn't refill my pain killers only refer me to a pain clinic (although she hadnt the foggiest where that was cause only the lady that processes the referrals knows that) but that lady says I can't get a referral till I see the actual dr. Not that I had known my new patient eval would be with a pa. They schedule me another appointment for the dr so i could get a referral so i could go to a pain clinic so i could get my pain pills refilled.... however the idiot front desk again set the appointment up with a PA because the dr was out all week!  <br/>  <br/> Now Im about out of meds so by the time I see the actual dr (supposedly tues) just so she can say  you have fibro sorry nothing we can do go see the pain clinic  wait for a referral to be mailed to us since they cant just hand it across the desk mind you and then call and make an appointment with the pain clinic which may or may not prescribe pain killers anyways. <br/>  <br/>  Oh and since they have been my only effective (when they are) treatment for about 2-3 yrs now my body is dependant (I am soooo not addicted however no matter what the medical community believes of 25yr olds and how if we take any drug it must be for fun) so Im going to be writhing in even more pain. Not that I am not already since Im so low on the drugs Im refusing to let myself take more than one at a time which means I can only really effectively dampen my pain from the  im going to kill myself  point to the  God can I please just go to sleep for a week or two  point for about 4 hours.  <br/>  <br/> I'm just having such a friggen hard time the last to weeks and I dunno what to do. I have no friends and no real family around (in-laws who are as different from me as fire is from ice-cubes so they really have no idea how to comfort me... if they even know what the word comfort is but thats a diff story... sort of) they all live other side of the country and have too many problems of their own for me to bother them with really  though ive still done that many times these past two weeks.  <br/>  <br/> And my beloved husband tries hard but he might be an orange that fell from an apple tree he still hit the ground too close sometimes. He doesn't really  get  what Im going through or just how bad it is and even when I explain it the relevations really only last an hour or two till he has to go to work or falls asleep or something and then I'm left alone again.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I'm just kinda at wits end and dunno what else to do anymore. The pain is killing me sometimes I think literally... <br/>  <br/>  <br/> sorry if i didnt make this spaced out enough or in the wrong place just needed to get it all out there and maybe in front of people who understand like im sure you guys do.,6,35,0.025723473,Experimental,Experimental

1475.825808,yes,no,2056,57231,1072,8,0,0,Although cholestyramine can be used for C.diff toxins  it is usually used in lyme patients for neurotoxins caused by borrelia.   <br/>  <br/> I agree with you tcw - I wish more information was available for herbs.  Unfortunately  there is not a lot of financial support from drug companies or the governement to pay for studies on the effectiveness of specific herbs.  <br/>  <br/> Unlike drug companies who can patent a specific drug and have exclusive rights to sell it in order to pay for their expenses  companies that sell herbs can't patent an herb so they don't pay for studies because they can't recoup the expense.  That said  you can find studies on some herbs or herbal products by searching medline.  <br/>  <br/> Detox as we discuss it here covers a very broad range of detox issues.  So much of what a person needs for detox depends on their specific genetics  combinations of exposures  amount of exposure etc.. <br/>  <br/> I'm happy for those who get well without going to the expense and effort of dealing with detox issues.  Unfortunately  based on my experience  I'm not one of them.   <br/>  <br/> For most of my life I was told that I couldn't tolerate abx because I was allergic.  Lab tests show that I am not allergic.  It appears that all along it was the die off that was making me so sick.   <br/>  <br/> I cannot tolerate treatment without extensive detox. I'm very lucky that my LLMD was open enough to learn what he needed to learn in order to help me and others like me.  As far as I'm concerned  my experience with treatment and detox confirms my genetic test results that show that I have detox issues  <br/>  <br/> When I bring up detox issues on this board it is not to sell anything or complicate treatment.  It is solely to help others who like me  need help in order to tolerate treatment. <br/>  <br/> For those who don't need or want it  great!  For those who do  thank goodness there are LLMD's who pay attention to clinical results rather than requiring studies before they will try to help us.  <br/>  <br/> Terry,16,18,0.049315068,Experimental,Experimental

1587.141314,no,no,9004,32523,2,0,1,0,My guess is that the vast majority of Lymies suffer from adrenal fatigue. <br/>  <br/>  http://www.project-aware.org/Resource/articlearchives/adrenalfatigue.shtml  <br/>  <br/> Surprisingly  the most common test for adrenal fatigue is not mentioned -- taking the blood pressure with the patient sitting and then standing up -- the blood pressure should increase and not stay the same or drop.  <br/>  <br/> On 2nd thought maybe that is the postural hypotension test that is mentioned -- a much more sophisticated and expensive version of this test is the tilt table test. <br/>  <br/> WV Hillbilly <br/> ------------------------------------------------- <br/>            <br/>  Adrenal Fatigue  <br/> by Vicki Wade  Pharm. D <br/> January 2005 <br/>  <br/> Have you recently experienced a major stress in your life  be it illness  job  death  children  etc? After this stress  have you felt as though you just cannot seem to get yourself together  or at least back to where you used to be?  <br/>  <br/> Are you usually tired when you wake up  but still  too wired  to fall asleep at night? Is it hard for you to relax or to get exercise? Do you find that you get sick more often and take a long time to get well? If so  then you  like many other Americans may be experiencing symptoms of Adrenal Fatigue. <br/>  <br/> Adrenal fatigue is not a new condition. People have been experiencing this condition for years. Although there is increasing physician awareness  many are not familiar with adrenal fatigue as a distinct syndrome. Because of this lack of knowledge  patients suffer because they are not properly diagnosed or treated. <br/>  <br/> Adrenal fatigue is a condition in which the adrenal glands function at a sub-optimal level when patients are at rest  under stress  or in response to consistent  intermittent  or sporadic demands. <br/>  <br/>  The adrenal glands are two small glands that sit over the kidneys and are responsible for secreting over 50 different hormones?including epinephrine  cortisol  progesterone  DHEA  estrogen  and testosterone. <br/>  <br/>  Over the past century  adrenal fatigue has been recognized as Non-Addison?s hypoadrenia  subclinical hypoadrenia  neurasthenia  adrenal neurasthenia  and adrenal apathy. <br/>  <br/> Generally patients who present with adrenal fatigue can often be heard saying   After______  I was never the same.   <br/>  <br/> The onset of adrenal fatigue often occurs because of financial pressures  infections  emotional stress  smoking  drugs  poor eating habits  sugar and white flour products  unemployment and several other stressors. <br/>  <br/>  After experiencing many of these events over a long period of time  the adrenal glands tend to produce less cortisol  the body?s master stress hormone.  <br/>  <br/> Cortisol?s main role in the body is to enable us to handle stress and maintain our immune systems. The adrenal gland?s struggle to meet the high demands of cortisol production eventually leads to adrenal fatigue. <br/>  <br/> Patients with adrenal fatigue have a distinct energy pattern. They are usually very fatigued in the morning  not really waking up until 10 AM  and will not usually feel fully awake until after a noon meal. <br/>  <br/>  They experience a diurnal lull in their cortisol (the stress hormone produced by the adrenal gland) and as a result  they feel low during the afternoon  generally around 2-4 PM. <br/>  <br/>  Patients generally begin to feel better after 6 PM; however  they are usually tired after 9 and in bed by 11 PM These patients find that they work best late at night or early in the morning. <br/>  <br/> Some key signs and symptoms of adrenal fatigue include salt cravings  increased blood sugar under stress  increased PMS  perimenopausal  or menopausal symptoms under stress  <br/>  <br/>  mild depression  lack of energy  decreased ability to handle stress  muscle weakness  absent mindedness  decreased sex drive  mild constipation alternating with diarrhea  as well as many others. <br/>  <br/> Although there no specific tests that will provide a true diagnosis of adrenal fatigue there are tests that may contribute to an assessment  such as a postural hypotension test  an AM cortisol test  or an ACTH stimulation test. <br/>  <br/>  It is customary for a physician to assess the adrenals together with thyroid tests to rule out insufficiency  which sometimes occurs in long-standing hypothyroidism. <br/>  <br/> A single determination of plasma cortisol or 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion is not useful and may be misleading in diagnosing adrenal insufficiency. <br/>  <br/>  However  if the patient is severely stressed or in shock  a single depressed plasma cortisol determination is highly suggestive. An elevated plasma ACTH level in association with a low plasma cortisol level is diagnostic. <br/>  <br/> Treatment for adrenal fatigue is relatively simple. Lifestyle modifications can be initiated to treat this condition. <br/>  <br/>  Simple changes such as more laughter (increases the parasympathetic supply to the adrenals)  small breaks to lie down  increased relaxation  regular meals  exercise (avoiding any highly competitive events)  early bedtimes and sleeping until at least 9 AM whenever possible can all benefit those experiencing adrenal fatigue. <br/>  <br/> A diet that would be conducive to treating adrenal fatigue includes one that combines unrefined carbohydrates (whole grains) with protein and oils (nuts and seeds) at most meals?olive  walnut  fiber  flax and high-quality fish oil. <br/>  <br/>  It is also important for patients to eat regular meals  chew food well  and eat by 10 AM and again for lunch. Patients should look to avoid any hydrogenated fats  caffeine  chocolate  white carbohydrates  and junk foods. Diets should have a heavy emphasis on vegetables.  <br/>  <br/> It may be of additional benefit that patients add salt to their diet  especially upon rising and at least a half-hour before their lowest energy point of the day. (Preferably  1/8 to 1/2 teaspoonful of sea salt  Celtic salt  or sea salt w/kelp powder added to an 8 oz glass of water). <br/>  <br/>  In adrenal fatigue  one should not follow the USDA?s Food Guide Pyramid  as these patients tolerate fewer carbohydrates and need more protein. <br/>  <br/> The addition of nutritional supplements may also offer additional benefits to patients experiencing adrenal fatigue. They should consider the addition of: <br/>  <br/> Vitamin C 2 000-4 000 mg/day Sustained Release  <br/> Vitamin E w/mixed tocopherols 800 IU/day  <br/> Vitamin B complex  <br/> Niacin (125-150 mg/day) ? as inositol hexaniacinate  <br/> B-6 (150 mg/day)  <br/> Pantothenic acid (1200-1500 mg/day)  <br/> Magnesium citrate (400-1200 mg)  <br/> Liquid trace minerals (zinc  manganese  selenium  chromium  molybdenum  copper  iodine)? calming effect  <br/> If depression is present ? Add SAM.e 200 mg bid; DL-Phenylalanine (DLPA) 500 mg bid  <br/>   <br/> Some herbal remedies that have been noted as possible therapies include Licorice  Ashwagandha  Maca  Siberian Ginseng  Korean Ginseng. <br/>  <br/>  Note: Licorice can and  if taken over time  does have a propensity to elevate blood pressure. It should not be used in persons with a history of hypertension  renal failure  or who currently use digitalis preparations such as digoxin. <br/>  <br/> Under the supervision of a physician hormone supplementation with DHEA  Pregnenolone  and Progesterone may also offer some benefits. There are several glandular extracts on the market that contain adrenal  hypothalamus  pituitary  thyroid  and gonadal that are also often recommended. <br/>  <br/>  Sometimes the initiation of hydrocortisone (Cortef®) may be necessary as a replacement hormone when cortisol is not being produced by the adrenals. While the initiation of corticosteroids  such as hydrocortisone may have quick and dramatic results  they can sometimes make the adrenals weaker rather than stronger.  <br/> As a result  the initiation of hydrocortisone is usually a last resort. <br/>  <br/>  It is important to note that patients may have to undergo treatment for 6 months to 2 years. <br/>  <br/> While a cortisol measurement may be helpful to confirm any thoughts or ideas that a patient may have decreased adrenal function  typically blood cortisol levels would be tested along with blood levels of potassium  and sodium. <br/>  <br/>  If the pituitary gland is the cause of adrenal failure electrolyte levels are usually normal. Practitioners usually pay attention to extremely low cortisol levels  which generally diagnoses Addison?s disease?a condition in which the adrenal glands are completely depleted  also considered a medical emergency.  <br/>  <br/> If you think you may be experiencing adrenal fatigue or if you are unsure  feel free to contact one of the consultant pharmacists at Bellevue Pharmacy Solutions at 1-800-728-0288. <br/>  <br/> Copyright © 1997-2005 ProjectAWARE.

They convinced me.  <br/>  <br/> I found this map  from 3 years ago  from Los Angeles County West Vector & Vector-Borne Disease Control District. Clicking on the left    locations of lyme  will bring up a map showing where Borrealis positive ticks were found.  <br/>  <br/>     http://www.lawestvector.org/     <br/>  <br/> I don't know about anyone else  but I'm about 6 miles from one of these sites.  <br/>  <br/> It is so maddening.

1685.905972,yes,no,1090,5588,43,19,0,0,This is an interesting thread.  I believe that I got bitten ~23 years ago  and was only mildly affected until 11 years ago when I had the seasonal winter flu that goes around  and was in bed for a couple of weeks.   <br/>  <br/> After that started to settle down  I had bad vertigo  then noticed neuro symptoms that weren't related to vertigo.  They told me I had  probable MS  and put me on interferons. <br/>  <br/> I started suspecting Lyme 2 years ago  but couldn't get a positive dx.  Quit the interferon.  <br/>  <br/> Then this winter  I got the nasty seasonal flu again  then got vertigo and basically had a relapse of the  MS.  <br/>  <br/> But this time we caught the little Lyme boogies red-handed!  Of course  I haven't been able to start treating them  because now my gall bladder went off and it's coming out Tuesday. <br/>  <br/> So I think  at least for me  when my system gets knocked back by something else  the Lyme boogies come out to play. <br/>  <br/> Still having neuro and fatigue problems  but am hoping that once we start treating the Lyme  the sx will get better.,26,14,0.060606061,Experimental,Experimental

You are looking at this as if you only have one bullet in the gun and it has to hit the target.  We all understand the problem. <br/>  <br/> Getting this out of the way  you are not confrontational at all in my opinion  you just want to be absolutely sure of any decision you make.  And there isn't a single person on this board who isn't rooting for you to get well.  Me included! <br/>  <br/> A lot of information is percolating showing promise of this new LED or infrared light in removing lyme from our bodies.  Personally  I believe it! <br/>  <br/> So it is simple : you can't get well with Dr. W. if you have lyme & Co. as your main problem.  Again  you get well far more quickly if lyme is the main issue.  If the main issue is mercury poisoning  candida  kidneys  endocrine system  liver  intestines  parasites  mold  EMF  dental (tmj  root canals  metals in the mouth  amalgams) on and on ... then those need to be addressed even if you get rid of lyme.  Mercury in some can take months to years to remove. <br/>  <br/> Shandy you can test for many of these things if you get a biotensor IMHO.  I believe it is the best thing I've purchased to get well.

1728.778696,yes,no,3019,125998,173,18,0,0,Pineapple  good questions. <br/>  <br/> I am also on the Lymenet_leaders group  where I try to remember to post the same notices so leaders of other groups can take them home to their groups. Recently someone mentioned copyright law. I have not worried about it  but maybe we should. The thing about the yahoo groups is they are kind of private. You have to answer a screening tool before your membership is approved. Yes people can lie but mainly it's a way to keep spammers off. It works for this purpose. I do post entire articles for the convenience of readers. I'm not sure how serious a concern it is. I think on a public forum it might be a bigger concern. <br/>  <br/> I do not automatically post every state's articles to all states  but often people are interested. I'm in CA but I loved the recent article from Cape Cod. It gives us ideas for articles that can fly in our own papers. If they are good articles  they make us happy. If they are bad articles  we are mad but at least we can write letters to editors. Sometimes there is an article that seems particularly relevant to one area and not others  so I post it only in those areas. <br/>  <br/> Also  on groups where I have moderators  I don't send notices directly to the groups  but to one moderator  who makes the decision on whether to post it. It gives a bit more local control. <br/>  <br/> Yes there are other general Lyme groups. I am a member of Lyme-Aid  for example  and it's a big group that cuts across state lines  but the owner moderates my posts. If she doesn't agree with what I'm saying  she doesn't post it!! I prefer a more open forum as long as people are respectful. <br/>  <br/> I am also up front about being supportive of ILADS and LDA  which may not be everyone's cup of tea  but I happen to think United We Stand  Divided We Fall. I don't agree with everything but I am involved and support group decisions. So that sets my family of state groups apart in some sense. <br/>  <br/> CaliforniaLyme has just amazed me  with its growth and the expertise and generosity of so many people. And we stay on topic  too! I hope the other state groups can rise to the same level. There are still so many people who fall through the cracks.  <br/>  <br/> I'd love to work with any state leader here who is interested in using my state group to unify and empower patients in their state. That's my dream. United  we'd be unstoppable. I would also be happy to work with leaders who already have their own groups  if I have anything they think would be helpful. <br/>  <br/> As I said before but it bears repeating  in several cases where there already were existing state groups  my group only serves as a message board and points to the other group for  membership. I have no interested in competing or dividing. I do however want to give people all the information and not censor unless it's destructive energy (which we have done only in the case of the attacks on ILADS  if my memory is correct). <br/>  <br/> Thanks for your support.,34,28,0.032315978,Experimental,Experimental

A retired professor of pharmacology told me a couple years ago that minocycline destroys the inner hair ear cells.   <br/>  <br/> ? My local pharmacist says she never heard of anyone having trouble from it.   <br/>  <br/> Uh . . . . <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  in reply to someone from another tread & others who may wonder - this might help explain why doctors don't have one general list to check for ototoxic  ototoxicity in drugs. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Researchers seem to differ on mino.  One doctor may be very firm in not using minocycline or zithromax while another may have those on the front line.    <br/>  <br/>  <br/> It is confusing that a drug can be on one ototoxic or vestibulur toxic list but not on another. I usually check four lists/books and try to get the most current ones.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The way ototoxic reactions are reported is not like you'd think.  <br/>  <br/> If a patient has a problem and reports it it might be recorded in a record somewhere as either vertigo  dizziness  tinnitus  hyperacusis  or hearing loss.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Only ear hair cells are destroyed might the drug be listed as ototoxic but some researchers connect any troublesome audiological symptoms as degrees of ototoxicity - some reversible  some not. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The degree or length of time these continue are not recorded. That would help. Also  blood levels are not usually helpful in reporting of ear reactions.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I had a conversation with a retired professor of pharmacology and he told me that minocycline destroys the hair cells.  I've not found that in print.  However  I don't have resources to buy a lot of books or even purchase full journal articles over the web.  I have found that it can clearly be toxic to the balance system  so if that's because of ear hair cells or another reason  I'm not sure. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I also have to wonder if some patients are  for some reason  more affected than others. And  herx can be part of it. <br/>  <br/> The B6 / mino article (     http://tinyurl.com/3xpvck     ) is from Germany. It might not have appeared in American medical journals. <br/>  <br/> Also  mino is being tested in some studies to prevent hearing loss with the inner ear injections of a very ototoxic drug  gentamicin  in a study with mice. So  that is very curious. But they add yet a third substance and that may matter tremendously in the outcome. PubMed  in general  does not have a lot of abstracts with ototoxic drugs that appear on lists elsewhere. <br/>  <br/> ====================== <br/>  <br/>     http://tinyurl.com/5jqhwy     - scroll down past ads <br/>  <br/> excerpt: <br/>  <br/> Ms. Suss points out that the Physicians Desk Reference (PDR) did not list ototoxic drugs until the 1989 and later editions.  <br/>  <br/> She refers to a separate document  Drug Interactions and Side Effects Index  which is keyed to the PDR.  <br/>  <br/> She then points out that the Index is incomplete: several problem drugs are not listed there. <br/>  <br/> ====================== <br/>  <br/> I'm not a researcher or an expert  just trying to make sense of what I've read. Hope it's not overwhelming. Wish it were clearer. And I wish I could be more concise. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The bottom line that one my otologists told me to remember is that any drug that trigger tinnitus  vertigo or hyperacusis can be ototoxic for my ears. He said to stop immediately so the chance to reverse that is better.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Still  many lyme patients report certain abx triggering tinnitus that clears once the lyme clears. It could be they were taking another substance that helped prevent damage or  for some reason they were not as affected in the ears as others.   <br/>  <br/> We still have so much to learn about all of this.  In the meantime  it's just wise to be aware of potential risks and alternatives to either add or substitute.   <br/>  <br/> However  NOT treating damaging infections because of potential side effects of drugs is simply NOT an option.  It is possible to find the correct treatment (s) that will address infections and ear safety. <br/>  <br/> Otologists  neurotologists  ENTs are the doctors of the ears. It's good to see them for any ear trouble - also because it's not always from lyme (babesia  other TBI bother ears) and there are also other sorts of  conditions that can affect ears/balance. <br/>  <br/> Always ask a specialist if there is a concern.  Our ears  our balance affects nearly everything we do in life  in relationships. <br/> If the balance is off  life itself is off balance.   <br/>  <br/> - <br/>   <br/>   [ 04.

Always maintain your center of gravity - never  over-reach  so that if you do wobble you won't so easily tumble. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ?  Feel the bottoms of your feet and an imaginary line from the tip of your head down through your spine so as to keep a straight posture - or at least that in your mind's eye. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ?  Keep a night light on at night so that if you get up you eyes can help with a visual point of reference.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ?  Wear shoes all the time so as to have a better balance and the weight of shoes reminds you where your feet are.  Don't know if you are a woman or a man but   no high heels  okay? <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ?  Shoes that give you good support are essential  so that if you start to wobble you have a better chance of staying on your feet.  Flip flops are not a good idea but  for slippers  sturdy step in low clogs work for me.  During the day  shoes with backs really will keep you safer. <br/>  <br/> ?  If you ever feel woozy  sit down  no matter where you are.  <br/>  <br/> ?  When you feel waves of fatigue  lie down.  Your head and torso lifted to a 20-30 degree angle is the best position for your inner ear. <br/>  <br/> ? Avoiding gluten  dairy  corn and soy may be of some help if there is inflammation or phlegm involved. <br/>  <br/> ? GINGER tea or GINGER capsules might help.  Magnesium  too.  B-12  B-6 and folic acid and BETA CAROTENE  too  are all very good for the ears.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ------ <br/>  <br/> I know you don't have a LLMD yet but you might ask those in the nearest lyme support group if anyone knows of an ENT or neurotologist (neuro + otologist) who is at least lyme friendly if not LL. <br/>  <br/> There are some tests they can do to help determine where this is coming from:  inner or middle ear or the brain (or both).   <br/>  <br/> It may be something different from lyme which is why it might be good to see a vestibular specialist.  vestibular means the whole inner/middle ear balance system. <br/>  <br/> However  ear doctors often prescribe steroids and steroids can make lyme blossom.   So  be very aware that you should avoid those unless it's to safe a live  eyes  or hearing. <br/>  <br/> there are some simple exercises that will help balance.  Tai Chi or Qi Gong (easier than Tai Chi).   And if you look at the VEDA website you can find out more about VESTIBULAR REHABILITATION. <br/>  <br/> Again  if you  could see a LL P.T. who does this  that is best as lyme really has some unique symptoms that leave most health professionals baffled. <br/>  <br/> ======= <br/>  <br/>   http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=065801    <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Topic: TINNITUS: Ringing Between The Ears; Vestibular  Balance  Hearing with compiled links <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ========== <br/>  <br/>  <br/>   http://www.vestibular.org/   <br/>  <br/> VEDA - Vestibular Disorders Association <br/>  <br/> -,7,5,0.139534884,Experimental,Experimental
1787.710044,no,no,4142,142874,837,0,1,1, emedicine - Scurvy - Vitamin C defiency  <br/>  <br/> History <br/>  <br/>     * Early symptoms are malaise and lethargy. <br/>  <br/>     * After 1-3 months  patients develop shortness of breath and bone pain. Myalgias may occur because of reduced carnitine production. <br/>  <br/>     * Other symptoms include skin changes with roughness  easy bruising and petechiae  gum disease  loosening of teeth  poor wound healing  and emotional changes. <br/>  <br/>     * Dry mouth and dry eyes similar to Sjögren syndrome may occur. <br/>  <br/>     * In the late stages  jaundice  generalized edema  oliguria  neuropathy  fever  and convulsions can be seen. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Physical <br/>  <br/>     * Vital signs: Hypotension may be observed late in the disease. This may be due to an inability of the resistance vessels to constrict in response to adrenergic stimuli. <br/>  <br/>     * Skin: Perifollicular hyperkeratotic papules  perifollicular hemorrhages  purpura  and ecchymoses are seen most commonly on the legs and buttocks where hydrostatic pressure is the greatest.  Poor wound healing and breakdown of old scars may be seen. <br/>  <br/>     * Nails: Splinter hemorrhages may occur. <br/>  <br/>     * Head and neck: Gum swelling  friability  bleeding  and infection with loose teeth; mucosal petechiae; scleral icterus (late  probably secondary to hemolysis); and pale conjunctiva are seen.  <br/>  <br/> Conjunctival hemorrhage  flame-shaped hemorrhages  and cotton-wool spots may be seen.  <br/>  <br/> Bleeding into the periorbital area  eyelids  and retrobulbar space also can be seen.   <br/>  <br/> Alopecia may occur secondary to reduced disulfide bonding. <br/>  <br/>     * Chest and cardiovascular: Scorbutic rosary (ie  sternum sinks inward) may occur in children.  <br/>  <br/> High-output heart failure due to anemia can be observed.  <br/>  <br/> Bleeding into the myocardium and pericardial space has been reported. <br/>  <br/>     * Extremities: Fractures  dislocations  and tenderness of bones are common in children.  <br/>  <br/> Bleeding into muscles and joints may be seen. Edema may occur late in the disease. <br/>  <br/>     * Gastrointestinal: Loss of weight secondary to anorexia is common. Upper endoscopy may show submucosal hemorrhage. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Causes <br/>  <br/>     * Scurvy is caused by a dietary deficiency of vitamin C. The body's pool of vitamin C can be depleted in 1-3 months. <br/>  <br/>     * Risk factors include the following: <br/>     * <br/>           o Babies who are fed only cow's milk during the first year of life are at risk. <br/>  <br/>           o Alcoholism and conforming to food fads are risk factors. <br/>  <br/>           o Elderly individuals who eat a tea-and-toast diet are at risk. Retired people who live alone and those who eat primarily at fast food restaurants face increased risk of deficiency. <br/>  <br/>           o Economically disadvantaged persons tend to not purchase foods high in vitamin C (eg  green vegetables  citrus fruits)  which results in them being at high risk. <br/>  <br/>           o More recently  vitamin C deficiency has been noted in refugees who are dependent on external suppliers for their food and have limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables. <br/>  <br/>           o Cigarette smokers require increased intake of vitamin C because of lower vitamin C absorption and increased catabolism. <br/>  <br/>           o Pregnant and lactating women and those with thyrotoxicosis require increased intake of vitamin C because of increased utilization. <br/>  <br/>           o People with anorexia nervosa or anorexia from other diseases such as AIDS or cancer are at increased risk of vitamin C deficiency. <br/>  <br/>           o People with type 1 diabetes have increased vitamin C requirements  as do those on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. <br/>  <br/>           o Because vitamin C is absorbed in the small intestine  people with disease of the small intestine such as Crohn  Whipple  and celiac disease are at risk. <br/>  <br/>           o Iron overload disorders may lead to renal vitamin C wasting.,1,7,0.112540193,Experimental,Experimental
1787.741282,yes,no,2569,65696,161,0,0,0,Hey Guys-- <br/>  <br/> I just want to give you a  warning  about the proper use of Fluconazole.  As I have posted previously  I was in horrific shape due to undetected low levels of magnesium.  I have been searching for answers as to the cause of my severely low levels of magnesium.   <br/>  <br/> I used to work in the business-side of the healthcare industry and contacted a number of leading magnesium researchers.  One of them  who is a physician at a prominent teaching hospital  just responded to my questions regarding magnesium deficiency.  I gave him the history of my disease and the list of antibiotics  antivirals  and anti-yeast meds which I have taken (been ill for 4 years).  He said that he's only aware of one published study regarding magnesium depletion and lyme disease but this was not necessarily  cause and effect.   Obviously  more studies need to be conducted due to the high number of lyme patients with low mag levels.  He then said that the most likely reason for my severely deficient mag levels was my long-term/high dosage use of Fluconazole.  <br/>  <br/> He said he is aware of a couple of published studies where Fluconazole was associated with cardiac issues and magnesium deficiency.  He said my long-term use of it may have really depleted my tissues of the mag which resulted in arrythmia  twitching  cramping  and severe fatigue. (I'm also deficient in vit D which exacerbated how horrible I felt) <br/>  <br/> He said that the best test for magnesium deficiencies are as follows: 1) magnesium parenteral loading test 2) RBC or Monocyte test for mag deficiency; 3) serum mag test <br/>  <br/> You can  as you guys know  have normal serum mag levels but still be mag deficient (this was my case).  Once I stopped the Fluconazole and started getting IVs and IMs of mag  my arrythmia and severe muscle cramps dissipated....Also  my fatigue greatly improved...It may take me awhile to replace the levels... <br/>  <br/> I'm certainly not trying to be an alarmist about Fluconazole.  I'm sure when used properly it can be great.  (I cannot recall the dosage I was on but I think it was twice a day for a few months)...This physician is truly one of the leading experts in magnesium deficiences in the United States so I would just at least heed his concerns and learn from my mistakes.... <br/>  <br/> Moral of the story:  just use Fluconazole wisely and in moderation; if you develop symptoms of mag deficiency  then you might consider stopping the Fluconazole....discuss with your doc.... <br/>  <br/> ...Hope this helps someone...,5,24,0.036866359,Experimental,Experimental

And plenty of people  including young ones  have died from it. So  it's important to call your LLMD  and in the future in such a circumstance  call on the emergency number.  And get checked out by a cardiologist.   <br/>  <br/> It's one heck of a nerve-wracking disease!  And your symptoms scream of heart issues  esp the symptoms that women get.  Although  with LD  who knows what is what; it's so difficult to figure out. <br/>  <br/> As Keebler said  magnesium is crucial  so try that and see what happens  too.,13,15,0.052173913,Experimental,Experimental

Apparently  this person was able to get multiple copies due to their involvement in the film. <br/>  <br/> Very powerful  and tear-jerking at times.  My husband watched it with me.  We both commented on just how similar Lyme cases are ... there may be degrees of differences in frequency of symptoms  severity of symptoms  but for the most part  they are so much alike.  Some are hit harder than others. <br/>  <br/> I consider myself one of the lucky ones ... I have been able to proceed on with my life.  It isn't always easy  and I will be fighting this demon for the rest of my life.  But I owe it all to one of the LLMDs in the film.  He has lost everything for what he believes in. <br/>  <br/> Can't wait for everyone to be able to see it!  Everyone!

After she felt the mosquito bite her in her ear she did have a mark.  NO  they did not treat her for Lyme at all while in the hospital  just kept her there and gave her nausea medication and something for dizziness. <br/>   <br/> She was hospitalized again a week ago with severe chest pains. She asked them about the information again on Lyme and they would not even discuss it as a possibility because her blood work showed negative 5 months ago. <br/>   <br/> They again kept her and ran more tests and told her nothing was wrong.  When she returned to her Dr's a week later he told her they found Fluid around her heart now and she has a cough that keeps her up all night .  They will not even give her anything for the cough.  They sent her for a echocardiogram of her heart and sent her home with no answer and more chest pains <br/>   <br/> I gave her the inforamtion I did find on the Web and she read through it and fees she has all the symptoms and explains how she is feeling but cannot get a Doctor to listen to her! <br/>  <br/> She has 2 little girls 5 & 6   we all try to help her as much as we can.

Hard for him to describe  but  after he started the  crypto  in addition to weird brain-working feelings  he had a brief recurrence of significant neuro symptoms he hadn't felt in a couple of years. He figures it's die off. (Ever the optomist....) <br/>  <br/> He's feeling clearer headed now than he has in a very very long time. He definitely has babs  and is also on mepron and doxy to treat it.  <br/>  <br/> Crypto added a real kick though. Who knows what other mystery bugs he has as well... might 'splain why his babs has been so intractable.  <br/>  <br/> BTW  he does a biofilm tx that includes green clay  apple pectin  charcoal  and lumbrokinase. Dunno if it's really hitting any biofilms  but it certainly has helped his gut and reduced his headaches (so we're assuming it's significantly helping detox  at a minimum).  <br/>  <br/> Thanks for keeping us updated.

It has the same morphology when it comes to the flagella. <br/>  <br/> There's only a few bacteria that have that same kind of flagellum that syphillis and Bb have. So many people think its VERY determinative of Lyme...cuz you'd think you would know if you could've been exposed to something like syphillis or you'd know you would have it already maybe. Although it takes years before syphilli sbecomes symptomatic as well sometimes many years. <br/>  <br/> It's possible that your body is making another kind of Ab that just so happens to closely match the Ab's that are normally made against the flagellum of Bb and Syphillis. <br/>  <br/> Chances are tho  it wont be a perfect match  so it wont bind tightly like a REAL Bb or syphillis Ab.  <br/>  <br/> So next question should be: Is your POSITIVE result for band 41 a: (+)  (++)  or (+++) ? <br/>  <br/> If its IND  or even a single +...then there's a stronger possiblity that the band is just cross-reactivity.  <br/>  <br/> If it's a STRONG POSITIVE signal  then it will appear as  ++  or +++ <br/>  <br/> With a strong signal  thats a sign that your body is only able to make that 1 type of Ab against Bb presently if its IgM or over your lifetime (Give or take.) if its IgG. Due to it's highly immunological evasiveness (Bb's.)  1 type of Ab being found is common. <br/>  <br/> Bb has lots of mechanisms that hide it from being identified by our immune cells and humoral fatcors.,25,14,0.063380282,Experimental,Training

Tests performed at St. Louis Children's Hospital indicate the child was infected with Ehrlichia chaffeensis  a disease related to Rocky Mountain spotted fever  according to State Public Health Veterinarian Howard Pue  D.V.M. <br/>  <br/>  Serious complications from ehrlichiosis are rare  but a death like this - of an otherwise healthy child - is a solemn reminder of the importance of avoiding tick bites to reduce the risk of getting a tick-borne disease   Pue said.   The risk of serious tick-borne disease is low for most people  but early symptoms are difficult to distinguish from other infectious and noninfectious diseases.  <br/>  <br/> The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services has received increased reports this year of several tick-borne diseases. Sixteen cases of ehrlichiosis have been reported so far  compared to an average of nine cases per year for the same time period over the past five years. In addition  54 cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever have been reported so far  compared to an average of 22 cases per year for the same time period over the past five years. Other tick-borne diseases reported in Missouri this year include two cases of tularemia and 10 cases of Lyme-like disease. <br/>  <br/>  While some of these cases are still under investigation or in various stages of testing  we are concerned about the large number of tick-borne disease reports we have received this year   Pue said. <br/>  <br/> Missouri State Epidemiologist Bao Ping Zhu  M.D.  hopes Missouri physicians will heed the importance of this spring's unexpectedly high number of tick-borne disease reports. <br/>  <br/>  These reports appear to indicate increased tick activity for 2007   said Dr. Zhu.   Ehrlichiosis  Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia can be life-threatening  and diagnosis can be very difficult.  <br/>  <br/> Because tick-borne illnesses cannot be quickly diagnosed through testing  treatment decisions must be based on clinical evidence and the likelihood of tick exposure  according to Zhu. <br/>  <br/>  The best way Missourians can protect themselves is to avoid tick bites and become more aware of the symptoms of tick-borne diseases   Pue said.   If you have been bitten by a tick and experience a sudden fever  headache  rash  achy muscles  nausea  vomiting or general body discomfort  you should contact your physician for evaluation.  <br/>  <br/> Tick-borne diseases can be effectively treated with appropriate antibiotics  especially when caught at an early stage  Pue added. <br/>  <br/> People can protect themselves from tick bites by: <br/>  <br/>     * Avoiding areas with lots of ticks ? walk in the center of trails to avoid overhanging grass and brush. <br/>  <br/>     * Keeping ticks off your skin ? apply a repellent that contains 20 percent or more DEET and read the label to make sure you are using it correctly. Wearing light-colored clothing that makes ticks easier to see and tucking your pants into your socks also can help. <br/>  <br/>     * Performing tick checks ? remove ticks from your clothes before going inside  disposing of them in a sealed plastic bag or other container. Check your body and your child's body for ticks after being outdoors  even in your own yard. <br/>  <br/> Pue urges parents to educate themselves about the safety of using insect repellents containing DEET on their children. The American Academy of Pediatrics has stated that insect repellents containing DEET are most effective against ticks and mosquitoes. Thirty percent DEET is the maximum amount currently recommended by the AAP for children over two months of age. DEET should not be used on infants under 2 months of age.,22,16,0.054380665,Training,Training

2243.222522,yes,no,3239,17914,225,46,0,0,All I know  is as a child I had many throat ear and kidney problems. Very difficulty focusing! <br/>  <br/> Don't laugh  but I remember having my eyes tested at school in first grade  and telling them I saw molecules. Junior high  had bad stiff neck. <br/>  <br/> Cramps in my legs at 17. <br/> In my late twenties I fell on the floor when I went to get up to get my baby in the a.m.. Thought my leg had gone to sleep. <br/>  <br/> Early thirty's one morning after having a minor surgery  literally could not lift my head. <br/> My husband at the time had to lift me off the pillow.  Lasted 24 hrs.. Hospital doped me up big time! <br/>  <br/> I also had severe ear pain that would come on out of now where!  I could've put my foot or fist through something it was so bad! <br/>  <br/> I was told t.m.j. and have been wearing a nightguard ever since. I also have a dual bite. <br/>  <br/> I had a cyst removed from my wrist from over use and as they were wheeling me out of the o.r. I asked the doc if I was supposed to feel funny. <br/> He said why  do you feel funny? <br/>  <br/> I kept hearing people calling my name  telling me to move my fingers open my eyes or whatever I could do  but I couldn't.  I was told I fainted. <br/>  <br/> In my thirties and fourty's lots of sinus infections  and one time had walking pneumonia. <br/>  <br/> The vibrations on the mini vans getting the kids off of them  would mess me up so bad. <br/>  <br/> I never thought anything about all of this until almost six years ago  when a fellow worker and friend saw me lose my balance.  I thought  old age. <br/> Then at school putting papers in the kids cubbies  I started shaking  and the teacher I worked with said are you alright?   <br/>  <br/> I told her I was fine  but she wouldn't believe me and asked the parent volunteer at the time to watch the class while she brought me to the nurse. <br/>  <br/> Severe high blood pressure  slurred speech  pins and needles  balance  and then my memory and cognitive went totally downhill. <br/>  <br/> Was taken many times from work to e.r. with breathing problems  high blood pressure  even after they gave me h.b. pills. <br/>  <br/> Were all those signs of lyme as a child way back  when?  I don't think we'll ever know! I do believe definately my immune system was  compromised. <br/>  <br/> I also had trouble with fine motor. Three times with uncontrollable laughter. <br/>  <br/> Doctor after doctor  test after test.  Finally an mri showed white spots. Had lumbar punture  and they lost the last part of the test. <br/>  <br/> Kept me at the hospital thinking it was a stroke. <br/> Finally a guardian angel said I think you have lyme.  I didn't believe her  but she insisted that I see a doctor her brother saw for lyme. <br/>  <br/> After three tests neg. western blot also.  Was put on antibiotics and later tested positive by an llmd. <br/>  <br/> My doctors here didn't believe it was lyme. Checked me for H.I.V.  M.S.

Tinnitus is more frequent of a barometer  but separate is vestibular toxicity  independent of hearing.   <br/>  <br/> And  yes  I think there may well be a connection to drugs that use the cytochrome P-450 liver detox pathway as  if that pathway is not working correctly or if a person has genetic or acquired porphyria . . . all of those can contribute to excess porphyrins that cause damage to cells in various places of the body  especially nerve cells. <br/>  <br/> Diflucan does metabolize using the C P-450 pathway  so that is a possible clue. <br/>  <br/> I don't know if Biaxin is a C P-450  but I recall some reports of high tinnitus from those who have taken that.   I get very loud tinnitus with Biaxin . <br/>  <br/> The vertigo is a puzzle.    <br/>  <br/> In the meantime  I wonder if ginger might offset some of the symptoms.  Beta carotene can lower porphyrins as can liver support herbs such as milk thistle and schizandra.  Frequent small meals with some carbs.   Fasting  a no or low carb diet can trigger porphryia in those with this. <br/>  <br/>  www.immunesupport.com   and   www.cpnhelp.org  have info on  secondary porphyria  - but I have to avoid the simple carbs they suggest.  Beta carotene - natural  not synthetic  seems to help  but I'm far from out of the woods. <br/>  <br/> Also be aware that lyme and TBI (and especially a herx) can cause some of the same symptoms as porphyria.  It's tricky to sort it all out.  A few doctors wonder if the herx is a sign of porphyrins and suggest backing off or trading meds. <br/>  <br/> I think that if some protective measures are taken that meds can be more easily tolerated. <br/>  <br/> Sorry  it's so complex and still unclear.   My hands are numb/ but painful  too  right now  so I have to stop here.   Maybe others can shed some light. <br/>  <br/> One ear specialist told me that they can't test all the drugs and people have different tolerances.  He said that if I get strong ear or vestibular symptoms that I can connect with a drug  to stop it immediately and  with a doctor's help  find another way to achieve the goal.   Sometimes  lowering the dose is all that is needed. <br/>  <br/> -,86,7,0.093023256,Training,Training

2414.529408,yes,no,2007,79259,7,0,0,0,Hello all. Back in the summer of 2002 I went to my doctor with a rash from an insect bite shaped like a target (.... I now know it's a bullseye rash). She told me she had never seen anything like it before. Another doctor came in and he too had never seen it before.  <br/>  <br/> I was given a topical cream and seven days of Erythromycin. After two days of vomiting I called and was told rather than a new RX just stop taking it and continue the cream. A few weeks later I got the flu and was told not to come in because they can't do anything unless I became dehydrated. I went in a number of times after that with problems like fatigue  not sleeping  depressed  trouble staying focused  sexual issues. I'm also not a big person. At the time of the rash I weighed 111 lbs. Within 8 or 9 months I was down to 102 lbs. I was told it was depression and prescribed anti-depressant. <br/>  <br/> The last time I went in for this issue I saw the same doctor I saw for the rash. I cried almost the entire appointment. I told her I was ripping my eye brows and eye lashes out. She asked me if I was going to kill myself or my children. At that point I knew I couldn't tell anyone about what I felt again. She told me it was PPD from my son who I had in '01. I was given another anti-depressant and sent on my way. <br/>  <br/> I now have memory and balance problems (along with those listed above and more). One of my memory lapses involved knowing that I took Erythromycin but not being able to remember why. After a few days I remembered the rash. I did a Google search of 'target rash'.... Long story short  I have a new doctor who believes this is/was Lyme. I went for an MRI today.  <br/>  <br/> I'm wondering if I should sue. It would be one thing if I just showed up with all these wierd neurological problems but they saw the rash and then just sat back while I got worse telling me it was just PPD. I'm just furious right now that if I had the proper treatment years ago none of this would be happening.,13,43,0.02020202,Training,Training

2434.600555,yes,no,2965,141655,535,35,0,0,Some people don't use biotensor  but use the whole body as a biotensor. It seems to work too. <br/>  <br/> My 4 year old daughter does it (I call the body swaying method). Cost of it: zero. She learned it when she was 3. It took a bit of practice and an open regulation (I opened her when she was blocked). <br/>  <br/> She tested for allergens in food  as she was born allergic to many foods. When she got some food from someone and we didn't know what it had inside (or in the restaurant)  she kept asking me to test for her. We learned this body swaying method from someone here  from lymenet. <br/>  <br/> Now she does by herself  for quite a long time. She stands up  and asks her food. So far  she never got any bad answers. She got very good at testing. We even do that on mushrooms we find in the woods.  <br/>  <br/> I have 'taught' this method to many people  and it's easy to learn. Probably much less sensitive than the tensor  but it worths trying before you buy a tensor. <br/>  <br/> Find a comfortable position  standing up  legs a bit open  stable and feel you are exactly 90 degrees and relaxed.  <br/>  <br/> Get something you like eating with one hand  put it above your head. In about one second  get your hand down the central line of your body  until you stop near your belly button. Don't do it too fast  nor too slow. <br/>  <br/> When your hand reaches the belly button area  keep it there  have your mind free while doing it all  and see if your body does something.  <br/>  <br/> You don't have to think about anything  just do it with a clear mind (as though you ingest the food energetically  or so). Your body has to move by itself in about a second after your hand reached the belly button area.  <br/>  <br/> If your body doesn't move  it didn't work  you have to re-start. If your body moves too quick after the hand reached the belly button area  it is also not good. There is a sort of fixed interval for the movement after the hand reach the belly button. <br/>  <br/> For every person I taught it  I didn't say how their bodies shall move  but when they get a yes  their bodies move to the front. When it's no  their vertebral columns go backwards.  <br/>  <br/> After you get practice on it  you don't need to put the hand from up to down  just approach to the substance you want to test and do an affirmation:  I need this . Your body will answer. <br/>  <br/> The only big problem is you have to have an open regulation. Or it won't work. <br/>  <br/> The ART course number 1 (dr. K.) is enough to learn how to open regulation. It worths every penny. <br/>  <br/> My daughter sometimes want so much to eat a cake or a sweet  her eyes shine. She asks and she often gets a 'no' as answer  specially if the sweet got colorants.  <br/>  <br/> Sometimes she weeps after she gets a 'no'  so much she wants to eat it but she knows she can't. So  her body answers different to her wishes  if you see what I mean.  <br/>  <br/> Selma,91,16,0.056537102,Training,Training

2449.148886,no,no,2223,16884,342,15,0,1,I called Nutribiotics about the reports of benzalkonium chloride in GSE and here is what they said in an email: <br/>  <br/>  Newsgroups  email groups  and web sites have received postings to the effect that GSE contains triclosan  benzelthonium chloride  or methyl paraben. The reason is that GSE is very similar in molecular weight to both benzelthonium chloride and triclosan  both of which are effective disinfectants  but are toxic to human and animal life. Some tests for BC  triclosan  and methyl paraben come up positive (which is more correctly called a  false positive ) and the same is happening for triclosan.  <br/>  <br/> Meanwhile  Citricidal (the brand of GSE NutriBiotic uses) has been tested for the presence of these toxins by independent labs  and has been proven clean. (Ex: Weston Gulf Coast Laboratories  Inc.  University Park  IL  test completed in March of 1992. Tested for heavy metals  Cyanides  Pesticides and PCBs and Benzalkonium Chloride. Results: None Detected.) In fact  the accusations about triclosan (used in many dish and hand soaps in the US) became so frequent a few years ago  that Citricidal began specifically testing each batch of GSE for its absence  and providing a Certificate of Analysis to that effect. <br/>  <br/> The truth is  Citricidal is not only effective  it has been in use for many years (20+). If these allegations had any validity  there certainly would be a history of complaints and judgments against the product  and it would have been removed from the market many years ago. The US FDA made inspections of the Nutribiotic manufacturing facility back in the 1990's and found no chemical preservatives; and the formula is the same today. Such rumors are false  and are not a threat to those armed with accurate information. The reports are certainly bothersome  but they have produced  false positives   not accurate profiles. The vast body of evidence from many years of use by thousands of satisfied consumers  doctors  manufacturers  and veterinarians  speaks most loudly against such reports. Citricidal and NutriBiotic GSE are proven  safe  and effective products. <br/>  <br/> If you have any further questions  please call us at 800-225-4345.

Our results demonstrated that increase of MnSOD (3-30 fold activity) in breast cancer cells suppressed the accumulation of HIF-l alpha protein under hypoxia in a dose dependent manner.  <br/>  <br/> These results suggest that MnSOD regulates HIP-l alpha and that the modulation of HIP-l alpha protein levels may account for the tumor suppressor function of SOD enzyme.  <br/>  <br/>  Many breast cancer cells typically exhibit ***lower expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD)*** compared to the normal cells from which they arise. This decrease can often be attributed to a defect in the transcription of SOD2  the gene encoding MnSOD;  <br/>  <br/> For those who are reading and wondering why people are using MMS to oxidize iron and Mn... <br/>  <br/> Re: iron and Bb: <br/>  <br/> *** We have identified an outer membrane protein (28 kDa) from B. burgdorferi B31 that  <br/>  <br/> bound holo-Tf but not apo-Tf.  ***  <br/>  <br/> transferrin (Tf)  <br/>  <br/>  Iron-loaded (holo)-transferrin (Tf)  <br/>  <br/> iron-depleted (apo-) Tf   <br/>  <br/> So Bb has a protein that binds to iron loaded transferrin. <br/>  <br/> And HO-1 liberates bound iron. <br/>  <br/>  Thus  cytoprotection by HO1 is attributable to its augmentation of ***iron efflux*** reflecting a role for HO1 in modulating intracellular iron levels and regulating cell viability.  <br/>  <br/>  However  the combination of holo-Tf with thrombin (but NOT apo-Tf with thrombin) caused brain edema  DNA damage  and intracellular iron accumulation in the ipsilateral basal ganglia.   <br/>  <br/> Bb uses iron another way too: <br/>  <br/>  Infective and noninfective strains of Borrelia burgdorferi  along with Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii  <br/>  <br/> possessed a single iron-containing superoxide dismutase (SOD).  <br/>   <br/>   [ 11.

Some of these members were from Maryland  Johns Hopkins to be more specific.   <br/>  <br/> It is shameful  to say the least  that our residents were taken advantage of by the ones charged with protecting the public's health and that this situation was allowed to happen anywhere  much less in our state. <br/>  <br/> In the meantime  volunteer patient advocates continued to be swamped with requests for help from people having multiple problems related to getting diagnosed  getting treatment  insurance coverage  etc. for their Lyme and tick borne diseases. <br/>  <br/> Until someone steps up to the plate and helps these patients  we will have to look for help wherever we can get it.   <br/>  <br/> I was told by the DHMH Deputy Secretary this past week they have no plans to do anything to address the current Lyme disease situation and if we wanted help to contact our legislators and go through the process.   <br/>  <br/> I was told their new  Maryland Get Ticked Off  Campaign that was recently announced is defunct and the reason it is a no-go is because they claim they have no money.   <br/>  <br/> I'm sorry they don't think the billions they get annually is enough to make a simple phone call to get free cases of brochures to hand out at the local fairs and booths they already set up for other reasons.   <br/>  <br/> I am sorry they feel they can't hold up a bit on the  Wear a Seatbelt  campaign  or the  How Many Fruits and Vegetables Do People Eat in One Day?  program long enough to address the fastest growing infectious disease in the state and the country that is destroying so many lives. <br/>  <br/> But they claim that is the case  so I am now looking for help from you  as directed.    <br/>  <br/> Please don't send me on a run-around or tell me to go to the DHMH.  They have already failed patients for the past 22 years (as long as I have been doing this) so I'd rather not play games at this point. <br/>  <br/> Thank you  <br/>  <br/> ``````````````````````````````````````````` <br/>  <br/> Attorney General's Press Release: <br/>  <br/>  http://www.ct.gov/ag/cwp/view.asp?a=2795&q=414284 ,26,12,0.074534161,Training,Training

PICC lines can last a couple months to a year. Ports can last several years. PICC placement is an outpatient procedure usually performed by a nurse. Ports as you mentioned require a more invasive surgical procedure because it is placed under the skin. <br/>  <br/> You can get PICC covers from places like Dry-Pro online to keep the site dry while showering. You can shower when the Port is deaccessed but will need to keep the site covered and dry when it is accessed. <br/>  <br/> My best advice  read up on all your options.

The time needed to inhibit  immobilize and kill the B31 strain of B. burgdorferi was determined.  <br/>  <br/> The MIC  MBC and concentration needed to immobilize the organism were determined for each antimicrobial for various strains of B. burgdorferi.  <br/>  <br/> Results Tigecycline inhibited the growth of and killed the organism more rapidly than doxycycline. Tigecycline was able to kill B. burgdorferi within 24 h at clinically achievable concentrations (&lt;1 mg/L).  <br/>  <br/> In contrast  doxycycline was bacteriostatic and required 48-72 h to achieve its maximal inhibitory effect. The anti-Borrelia activity of the antibiotics was tested against 20 different isolates from three species.  <br/>  <br/> Tigecycline was 16- to 1000-fold more active than doxycycline at immobilizing Borrelia for the 20 isolates tested.  <br/>  <br/> Conclusions We demonstrate that the in vitro activity of tigecycline against B. burgdorferi is superior to that of doxycycline. Tigecycline acted more rapidly and was bactericidal  whereas doxycycline was bacteriostatic and required a more prolonged co-incubation to achieve its maximal inhibitory effect. <br/>  <br/> PMID: 19182236 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher],9,10,0.082677165,Training,Training
2517.753485,no,no,3183,1415,37,0,0,0,On July 13  a World Health Organization (WHO) Global Alert headlined   WHO recommendations on pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccinations  suggest that universally mandated ones are coming. It stated that on July 7  the pharmaceutical industry-dominated Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization held an  extraordinary meeting in Geneva to discuss issues and make recommendations related to vaccine for the pandemic (H1N1) 2009.  <br/>  <br/> There's no pandemic nor until recently a single death anywhere attributable to Swine Flu. Yet WHO said the virus  is considered unstoppable   while admitting little evidence of spread so far  most cases are mild  and many people recover unaided. Nonetheless  all countries will need vaccines and should follow these priorities as initial supplies will be limited: <br/>  <br/> -- immunize health care workers  to protect the essential health care infrastructure;  then <br/>  <br/> -- pregnant women; children over six months of age  with one of several chronic medical conditions;  healthy young adults aged 15 - 49; healthy children; healthy adults aged 50 - 64; and finally healthy adults aged 65 or older. <br/>  <br/> WTO suggested the risks in stating  new technologies are involved in the production of some pandemic vaccines  which have not yet been extensively evaluated for their safety in certain population groups...  As a result   post-marketing surveillance  and  post-marketing safety and effectiveness studies  are essential so that countries can adjust their vaccination policies. <br/>  <br/> WHO  recommendations  are binding on all 194 member countries in case a pandemic emergency is declared under the 2005 International Health Regulations Act and April 2009 WHO pandemic plan. <br/>  <br/> It's crucial to understand that these vaccines are experimental  untested  toxic and extremely dangerous to the human immune system. They contain squalene-based adjuvants that cause a host of annoying to life-threatening autoimmune diseases. They must be avoided  even if mandated. It's also known that vaccines don't protect against diseases they're designed to prevent and often cause them. They should be banned but proliferate anyway because they're so profitable  and if globally mandated to the greatest extent ever. <br/>  <br/> Get ready because that's precisely what's coming - universal orders to risk toxic vaccine hazards. In the coming weeks  the dominant media globally will get into high gear fear-mongering mode to convince people voluntarily to submit to jeopardizing their health and well-being. It's essential to refuse and be safe and international law absolutely protects us. <br/>  <br/> Stephen Lendman is a Research Associate of the Center for Research on Globalization.

Several of these infections may be life threatening. Human babesiosis is an emerging zoonosis that is transmitted by the same tick that transmits Lyme disease and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis.  <br/>  <br/> METHODS: We briefly review these zoonoses and present a case of a renal transplant recipient who survived infection by Babesia microti contracted through blood transfusion.  <br/>  <br/> RESULTS: A recipient of a living-related renal transplant developed acute postoperative hemolytic anemia. The etiology of this anemia was diagnosed by peripheral red blood cell smear as Babesia microti. The patient was managed by a reduction in transplant immunosuppressive therapy and administration of clindamycin and quinine antimicrobials.  <br/>  <br/> CONCLUSIONS: Transplant patients may contract babesiosis after tick exposure and/or via blood transfusion. The diagnosis of babesiosis may be confused with malaria and should be included in the differential diagnosis of posttransplant hemolytic-uremic syndrome in organ transplant patients. <br/>  <br/> PMID: 10919602 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],35,12,0.07239819,Training,Training

Here's hoping that you already have a good LLMD  (?) but I am concerned that a doctor accepted a negative lyme WB if you have babesia.    Most good doctors would look further. <br/>  <br/> As for if babesia can cause all the symptoms you have  perhaps. However  it's best for a full clinical evaluation by a LLMD who has seen hundreds - or thousands - of patients with the various combinations.   They would need to see you in person and do a full history. <br/>  <br/> You may already be set with a doctor  and all the links you need. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> If not  in the progression of link below  the first few links will explain the current medical/political situation and WHY a certain kind of doctor is needed - and WHY most doctors - and labs - are not adequate for chronic stealth infection diagnostics. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> You have to know about the politics first so that you can then find the best help possible as quickly as possible. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Sadly  you have sort of entered a graduate level class. Be aware that most medical schools do not teach about tick-borne disease (TBD). <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Best of luck to you. <br/>  <br/> --------------------- <br/>  <br/>  <br/>     http://tinyurl.com/2dmvs2      <br/>  <br/>  <br/> From the May 2007 issue of Clinical Advisor (home page:  www.clinicaladvisor.com  ) <br/>  <br/>  <br/> CONTROVERSY CONTINUES TO FUEL THE  LYME WAR  <br/> By Virginia Savely  RN  FNP-C <br/>  <br/> ***** <br/>  <br/> As two medical societies battle over its diagnosis and treatment  Lyme disease remains a frequently missed illness.

I just finally got one to use temporarily until mine is back in commission. <br/>  <br/> I just wanted to clarify a couple of things.  Some of the Green Santa's want to stay anonymous.  I will respect their wishes. <br/>  <br/> If someone asks me for an address  I do my best to get it for them.  Sometimes people do not answer their pm's for awhile  so sometimes it takes awhile to get an answer.  Sometimes  people don't answer their pm's at all! <br/>  <br/> Because we sometimes have more than 1 green santa to help families with multiple kids  it can get very confusing for people to keep track of what they received from whom.  For instance  we have some families with 5 children  so that could be 10 different green santas (stocking stuffers and presents). <br/>  <br/> I have received a couple of emails from people trying to figure it all out.  And remember  Christmas can be a very busy and hectic time.  And if you are affected by LD  it can be really hard to keep things straight. <br/>  <br/> Regarding gift cards - we only give them to people who are able to shop or people that come in at the very last minute asking for help. <br/>  <br/> I do have a couple of pm's that I just read from people wanting to thank their Green Santas.  I will direct them to this post. <br/>  <br/> Thanks again for everyone that helped make Operation Green Santa a success again this year. <br/>  <br/> Julie,37,15,0.057142857,Training,Training

September 14  2007 <br/>  <br/>  ImmuneSupport.com <br/>  <br/> 09-23-2007  <br/>   <br/> Welcome to our Live Chat Event with Lucinda Bateman  MD. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Dr. Bateman: There are a growing number of research publications regarding the use of cardiopulmonary exercise testing for the evaluation of ME/CFS patients.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> There were a number of papers presented at the Ft. Lauderdale IACFS/ME scientific conference last January 2007. Abstracts or summaries are available on line.* Finding these names could lead to a search of other publications by the authors specifically  which came from several countries. <br/>  <br/> My experience with exercise testing was in collaboration with researchers at the University of the Pacific - Mark VanNess  Chris Snell  Staci Stevens  and others on their research team. I referenced a selection of papers in my article  ?CFS and the Exercise Conundrum? which is available online as well. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Cardiopulmonary exercise studies are still in the research phase and so are available only on a limited basis for clinical use as a diagnostic tool or to guide exercise advice for ME/CFS.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> They are usually done by exercise physiologists or in the pulmonary departments of academic centers  rather than cardiologists who do treadmill tests to screen for heart disease. I hope we can soon take the information from research to a point where it can be used more widely in a clinical setting. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> * * * * <br/>  <br/> Q:  About your  Exercise Conundrum  article on strength building for CFS & FM patients - do you take into account that some of us get worse with time? I had slow onset CFS  and the amount I could do became less and less.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Dr. Bateman: Certainly the nature and course of illness is different for everyone  but a point I wanted to make in the article is that deconditioning invariably plays a role in functional decline and rise in comorbid conditions over time. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The other point is that we must respect the illness of an individual  and tailor physical conditioning to the pathology that exists. If you can physically condition within limited guidelines  you should. If you try and can?t do anything without relapse  then you must obey the pathology  but physical deconditioning still remains an unfortunate insidious co-factor. <br/>  <br/> ============ <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Here's a nine-page article with tremendous detail to understanding physiological aspects of exercise intolerance or regaining ground after illness - with great information on what can help.  <br/>  <br/> Reading about ATP and mitochrondia was very helpful to making sure my nutritional support doesn't miss something essential. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> While this is not specifically about lyme  much of the research is still quite applicable.  <br/>  <br/> --------- <br/>  <br/>  www.cfids.org/sparkcfs/working-out.pdf  <br/>  <br/> WHEN WORKING OUT DOESN'T WORK OUT  <br/>  <br/> By Dr. Christopher R.

This might include: <br/>  <br/> ? Defects of oxidative metabolism  <br/>  <br/> ? Dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system and HPA-axis (CRH  cortisol and aldosterone)  <br/>  <br/> ? Presence of chronic or latent reactivating infection  <br/>  <br/> ? Dysregulated immune or inflammatory systems (cytokine production  natural killer cell function  complement activation) <br/>  <br/> ? And other yet-to-be clarified processes. <br/>  <br/> It is not difficult to imagine an exercise or activity threshold in someone with CFS after which the body experiences physiologic injury that contributes to post-exertional malaise.  <br/>  <br/> It is not necessary to understand this before we respect it. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> - full article at link <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ============================ <br/>  <br/>  <br/> While some (many?) cases of CFS might be undiagnosed lyme  this information may be helpful to patients across the board. <br/>  <br/> Even if from lyme  it helps us understand how better to take care of ourselves while seeking treatment/resolution. <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  www.cfids-cab.org/MESA/Lerner.html  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Cardiac Insufficiency Hypothesis - article and many links  including to: Pittler MH  Schmidt K  Ernst E.

In some infections  IgG antibodies may be detectable for years.  <br/>  <br/> Because Borrelia burgdorferi is a chronic persistent infection that may last for decades  you would think patients with chronic symptoms would have positive IgG Western blots.  <br/>  <br/> But actually  more IgM blots are positive in chronic borreliosis than IgG. Every time Borrelia burgdorferi reproduces itself  it may stimulate the immune system to form new IgM antibodies. <br/>  <br/> Some patients have both IgG and IgM blots positive. But if either the IgG or IgM blot is positive  overall it is a positive result.  <br/>  <br/> Response to antibiotics is the same if either is positive  or both. Some antibodies against the borrelia are given more significance if they are IgG versus IgM  or vice versa.  <br/>  <br/> Since this is a chronic persistent infection  this does not make a lot of sense to me. A newly formed Borrelia burgdorferi should have the same antigen parts as the previous bacteria that produced it. <br/>  <br/> But anyway  from my clinical experience  these borrelia associated bands usually predict a clinical change in symptoms with antibiotics  regardless of whether they are IgG or IgM.  <br/> =========== <br/>  <br/> TREATMENT      ***    www.ilads.org  <br/>  <br/> ILADS <br/> The International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) provides a forum for health science professionals to share their wealth of knowledge regarding the management of Lyme and associated diseases. <br/>  <br/> **************** <br/>  <br/> SENSITIVITIES:  EYES?LIGHTS  NOISE/SOUNDS  AND CHEMICAL SMELLS !! <br/>  <br/> Betty?s ROLL CALL of MEMBERS WITH EXTREME SENSITIVITIVITIES TO LIGHTS  SOUNDS/NOISE  AND CHEMICAL SENSITIVITIES <br/>  http://flash.lymenet.org/ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=046537#000000   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> EYE SENSITIVITIES & NOIR  no infrared sunglasses info.  2-28-06 updated YES  I have what you have!

I was pretty much in lala land. <br/>  <br/> I still have this problem although not as bad. I had someone help pay for a refurbished ion foot spa earlier this year from someone on lymenet.  <br/>  <br/> I keep thinking I will recall who that was so I can thank them..or wonder if I did thank them. <br/>  <br/> If you are reading this will you remind me who you are.

2874.369267,yes,no,2520,5934,1072,65,0,0,Jam  <br/> Thanks for your thoughtful response.  I've looked through Dr. S's work but have never seen anything that addresses the HLA testing in conjunction with mold antibody testing.  As far as I can tell  he doesn't test antibodies for mold in people.   <br/>  <br/> This may be one area that he is missing and possibly why some people with the dreaded genotype don't get well?? <br/>  <br/> I had testing done 3 years ago at Immunosciences Lab before they stopped doing testing.  These were ELISA tests for IgG  IgM  IgA and IgE for a number of molds.  I had antibodies to every mold but they were within reference range which means they were not considered abnormal. <br/>  <br/> I do have the worst HLA genotype for mold  borrelia and spider bite toxins.  Really makes me wonder if antibodies would be a lot higher if I could make antibodies to the mycotoxins. <br/>  <br/> I do have mold in my house so all of the info you've provided is helpful. <br/>  <br/> My husband and I worked very carefully (after doing considerable research) on killing the mold.  The problem is that while killing the mold will stop production of more mycotoxin producing mold  it does not get rid of the mycotoxins that are left behind.   <br/>  <br/> My muscle tester had me use essential oils and diffusers (with motors on them) to get rid of mycotoxins.  It was not cheap and it did take a long time because I had 4 different combinations of essential oils to use and some of them had to be diffused for days.  This had to be done in 4 different areas plus we had to spray stuff in vents in one bathroom for days.   <br/>  <br/> I'm getting ready to do mold testing now to see how well it all worked.  I may use bejoy's solution of ozone if I have further work to do although my research indicated that ozone wasn't effective.  It appears to have been effective for her though so it's worth considering.  <br/>  <br/> One more note:  I got the weird black fungus on my tongue from tindamax.  My doctor put me on an anti-fungal (sporonax).  Interestingly  the only time I've been able to lose weight was on prescription anti-fungals.  No amount of calorie restriction has helped.  I've lost 4 lbs since I started this anti-fungal.  Hopefully that will continue.   <br/>  <br/> Seems odd though because if mycotoxins cause weight gain then you would think killing the fungus would cause weight gain due to increased mycotoxins. sigh   It's hard to reconcile it all logically it seems or maybe I'm missing something. <br/>  <br/> Terry,184,19,0.047297297,Training,Training

This lasted about three weeks and I freaked out thinking I was progressing towards a wheelchair.

Liver support is vital  but a  flush  can just be far too hard - and some are way too much oil for any liver to handle. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> If one has gallstones  there are some other wonderful things   Stonebreaker  is just one herb that works well. Rhubarb  too. <br/>  <br/> I'll post some things about the liver and come back with the gallbladder stuff.    <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ============== <br/>  <br/> From a previous post I compiled a while back: <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I don't like the idea of a cleanse or a flush - or the action or event of a  detox  but  rather  on-going support so the liver will do it's own best work on its own timetable.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> To speed it up can be dangerous but to offer nutrients so it can work better is the idea. The liver does so much more than just detox - so a full support is the idea. <br/>  <br/> Still  for our purposes  especially when taking meds that can damage the liver  protection is vital. Milk thistle is one of the best protecters  but there are many others. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I think some of the detox teas can be too harsh but  sometimes  they just use the name and it is more of a support. It's important to read as much as you can about the liver and how it works.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Diet is first big help - avoiding bad fats and processed foods and eating enough veggies for the body to have enough bulk to detox naturally. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Here are some articles with ideas beyond milk thistle: <br/>  <br/> ----------- <br/>  <br/> From Townsend Letter: <br/>  <br/>   http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfreeprint.asp?docid=1G1:130779774&ctrlInfo=Round20%3AMode20d%3ADocFree%3APrint&print=yes    <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Liver support: an evidence-based review & call for research.(Naturopathic Perspectives) <br/>  <br/> Discussed at length: <br/>  <br/> Bupleurum  <br/>  <br/> Schizandra  <br/>  <br/> Phosphatidyl choline   <br/>  <br/> Inositol  Milk  <br/>  <br/> Thistle Seed (Silybum marianum)   <br/>  <br/> Turmeric (Curcuma longa)   <br/>  <br/> Dandelion root (Taraxacum officinale)   <br/>  <br/> Artichoke (Cynara scolymus)   <br/>  <br/> and Other Liver Supportive Botanicals such as Andrographis Paniculata and Picrorhiza Kurroa . . . . <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ====================== <br/>  <br/>  <br/>   http://oneearthherbs.squarespace.com/diseases/understanding-the-liver.html    <br/>  <br/> Understanding the Liver <br/>  <br/> Excerpt: <br/>  <br/> . . .

Surprisingly  the only anti-chlamydial agent that did not cause hepatitis in some patients was NAC. In fact  NAC is recognized as being protective.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> See attached references.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> My conclusion is that NAC should be the first agent in an anti-chlamydial regimen and should be a constant part of the therapy for this protective effect  not to mention it?s effect against elementary bodies.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> . . . more at link. ? with some discussion. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ======================== <br/>  <br/>  <br/> NAC is explained in the articles below: <br/>  <br/>   http://www.vrp.com/articles.aspx?ProdID=art2168&zTYPE=2    <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The Liver: Detoxifying This Vital Organ Nourishes Overall Health and Vitality - By Sherrill Sellman  ND <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ===================== <br/>  <br/>  <br/>   http://www.vrp.com/articles.aspx?ProdID=art1890&zTYPE=2   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Liver Protection: Laying the Foundation for Optimal Hepatic Health - By Kathy E.

2935.612113,no,no,4915,11195,1238,74,0,0,FYI - from the Humaworm site... <br/>  <br/> The Symptoms of Parasite Infections <br/>  <br/>   <br/>  <br/> STOMACH & INTESTINAL COMPLICATIONS ? The sheer number of parasites in the lower digestive system and the toxic waste produced by them can cause these problems: <br/>  <br/> Diarrhea <br/>  <br/> Chronic Constipation <br/>  <br/> Gas & Bloating <br/>  <br/> Digestive Problems <br/>  <br/> Excessive Early Bowel Movements (very explosive bowel movements very soon after eating) <br/>  <br/> Abdominal Pain <br/>  <br/> Mucus in the Stools <br/>  <br/> Leaky Gut <br/>  <br/> Nausea <br/>  <br/> Hemorrhoids <br/>  <br/> Burning in the Stomach <br/>  <br/> Bloody Stools <br/>  <br/>   <br/>  <br/>   <br/>  <br/> FATIGUE - The toxic metabolic waste overloads and overworks the organs of elimination and taxes the central nervous system causing: <br/>  <br/> Chronic Fatigue Syndrome <br/>  <br/> Low Energy <br/>  <br/> Lethargy <br/>  <br/> Excessive Weakness <br/>  <br/>   <br/>  <br/>   <br/>  <br/> SKIN DISORDERS & ALLERGIES ? Parasites that penetrate the skin cause itching.  When tissue becomes inflamed from these parasites  the body?s white blood cells increase to defend the body.  This reaction causes skin rashes and food allergies to appear. Parasites also create toxins and the skin  being the largest organ  tries to remove these toxins which causes many skin problems.  Symptoms include: <br/>  <br/> Dry Skin <br/>  <br/> Dry Hair <br/>  <br/> Brittle Hair <br/>  <br/> Hair Loss <br/>  <br/> Allergies <br/>  <br/> Itchy Nose <br/>  <br/> Itchy Anus <br/>  <br/> Itchy Skin <br/>  <br/> Hives <br/>  <br/> Allergic Reactions to Food <br/>  <br/> Crawling Sensation Under the Skin <br/>  <br/> Rashes <br/>  <br/> Weeping Eczema <br/>  <br/> Cutaneous Ulcers <br/>  <br/> Papular Lesions <br/>  <br/> Swelling <br/>  <br/> Sores <br/>  <br/>   <br/>  <br/> MOOD & ANXIETY PROBLEMS ? Once again  it?s the toxic metabolic waste produced by the parasites that attack the central nervous system causing: <br/>  <br/> Mood Swings <br/>  <br/> Nervousness <br/>  <br/> Depression <br/>  <br/> Forgetfulness <br/>  <br/> Unclear Thinking <br/>  <br/> Restlessness <br/>  <br/> Anxiety <br/>  <br/> Slow Reflexes <br/>  <br/>   <br/>  <br/> SLEEP DISTURBANCES ? The physical presence of the parasites themselves are a nuisance to the human body.  The body reacts to them during periods of rest  this in turn produces: <br/>  <br/> Insomnia <br/>  <br/> Teeth Grinding During Sleep <br/>  <br/> Bed Wetting <br/>  <br/> Drooling While Asleep <br/>  <br/> Disturbed Sleep ? Multiple Awakenings <br/>  <br/>   <br/>  <br/> WEIGHT & APPETITE PROBLEMS ? Parasites live undetected by their hosts.  They rob the body of all essential nutrients (they get the choicest nutrition from the food you eat) and you are left with the fats  sugars  etc.  Many overweight persons are infested with parasites  they stay hungry which leads to overeating because of the parasites. Depending on the type of parasite infestation  many people are malnourished  they can?t gain weight  again  because of the parasites.  This is why parasites cause: <br/>  <br/> Weight Gain <br/>  <br/> Long-Standing Obesity <br/>  <br/> Loss of Appetite OR <br/>  <br/> Uncontrollable Hunger Eating More Than Normal BUT Still Feeling Hungry <br/>  <br/> Inability to Gain or Lose Weight <br/>  <br/>   <br/>  <br/> MUSCLE & JOINT COMPLAINTS ? Parasites can travel to almost all soft tissue including in the joints and muscles where they cause cysts and inflammation that is commonly mistaken as arthritis and muscle pain.  The toxins from parasites can also pool in the joints and in muscle tissue causing:  <br/>  <br/> Muscle Pain <br/>  <br/> Joint Pain <br/>  <br/> Muscle Cramping <br/>  <br/> Numbness of the Hands and/or Feet <br/>  <br/> Heart Pain <br/>  <br/> Pain in The Navel <br/>  <br/> Pain in the Back  Thighs or Shoulders <br/>  <br/> Arthritic Pains <br/>  <br/> Fast Heartbeat <br/>  <br/>   <br/>  <br/> BLOOD DISORDERS ? The parasites get the good vitamins  including iron  leading to: <br/>  <br/> Hypoglycemia <br/>  <br/> Anemia <br/>  <br/>   <br/>  <br/> SEXUAL & REPRODUCTIVE PROBLEMS ? With a weakened immune system caused by parasites and their waste you also can experience: <br/>  <br/> Male Impotence <br/>  <br/> Erectile Dysfunction <br/>  <br/> PMS <br/>  <br/> Candida ? Yeast Infections <br/>  <br/> Urinary Tract Infections <br/>  <br/> Cysts & Fibroids <br/>  <br/> Menstrual Problems <br/>  <br/> Prostate Problems <br/>  <br/> Water Retention <br/>  <br/>   <br/>  <br/> OTHER SYMPTOMS ?

3013.882608,no,no,1015,68518,114,2,0,0,I don't buy that line of thinking. It doesn't apply to healthy people that never get sick  and that's because they have a very strong immune system that squashes the bugs/viruses before they can do any significant amount of damage. I was one of those people before I got slymed by a tick! <br/>  <br/> The reason that people feel tired  exhausted  are coughing up flem  and achy is not because their immune system is working properly  but because of the havoc that the bugs are causing. <br/>  <br/> I believe that most lymies don't catch colds and flu at all  or at least not as often is because their immune systems are in high gear all the time.  Their immune systems can't get rid of the really bad things that are killing them  but it can easily take care of a common cold or flu. <br/>  <br/> Another reason is because of way less exposure to the public  family  and friends. Interaction with other people in public places like School  Church  Movie Shows  and Restaurants is how a lot of people catch things.,9,25,0.032608696,Training,Training

3015.92911,no,no,4506,100943,2,0,0,0,Meeting Our Goals <br/>  <br/> Now that all the chatter has died down about our Congressional Briefing  it is incumbent on us to address the many issues that were raised about it.   <br/>  <br/> I would first like to thank all the people who supported our project both financially and in spirit.  You helped us reach our goal of having every congressional office receive a copy of Andy's DVD & Pam's book.   <br/>  <br/> We talked to people from all over the country and made many new friendships as well as cementing old ones.   <br/>  <br/> Your encouragement and faith in what we were trying to achieve was a great inspiration to us.  The great success was not about us but about you and your support. <br/>  <br/> Our critics were few  but their voices were loud.  It is tempting to be angry about the mischaracterizations and attempts to discredit our goals  as well as the efforts to stop the event itself.   <br/>  <br/> Despite all of that  we were pleased to report a packed house and very favorable reaction from the members and staff that attended. We have sent out over 85 thank you letters to members of Congress and their staffs who attended. <br/>  <br/> We choose to not publicly address our critics who demand harmony and cooperation  at the same time depicting good faith efforts as creating discord and chaos merely because they were not done in their name. <br/>  <br/> The NatCapLyme organized congressional briefing was designed to include all.  The idea throughout was to make it a grassroots project that represented the efforts and plans of many  without making any person or group the exclusive central focus.   <br/>  <br/> From the first  help and support was sought from all support groups and their members from across the country  with a sense of common purpose and joint effort.   <br/>  <br/> To make one group more prominent than another would have detracted from that goal.   Everyone had to be treated equal or the project would have failed.  To succeed  our legislators had to perceive that our Lyme community was united. <br/>  <br/> Pat Smith and LDA were invited to participate.  In fact  all groups and their group leaders were invited to participate.  Each was contacted by email and a follow-up telephone call.  Not all responded. <br/>  <br/> There has been criticism of the strategy  timing  choice of content  method of invitation  and funding of the congressional briefing.  We welcome the discourse and diversity of opinion.   <br/>  <br/> However  we are content to let the results stand for themselves  even when it is claimed by some that the success of the event was really because of their separate activities.  <br/>  <br/>  That does not matter.  What does matter is the outcome  and we're happy to have everyone who wants to take credit  do so. <br/>  <br/> It is important to clarify that NatCapLyme is not a part of or associated with either LDA or LDF and neither it nor our members are working to promote either's agenda.   <br/>  <br/> We have worked with and supported both organizations as well as independent groups and ILADS over the years.  Rather   <br/>  <br/> NatCapLyme has been and is an independent organization; we take pride in being open and accessible to all and in trusting our own judgment and making our own decisions.  <br/>  <br/>  We believe that strength comes from considering all opinions and approaches  just as does our Supreme Court when it held that the truth will emerge from the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources. <br/>  <br/> We do not believe that a national organization is imperative in achieving unity.   Unity will come from respect and acknowledgement for each other and validating our mutual efforts.   <br/>  <br/> There are many groups and individuals who have worked tirelessly for this cause.  Diversity of opinion leads to dialogue and dialogue leads to change.  For far too long this community has lived in fear  anger and distrust.    <br/>  <br/> It would be gratifying to see these behaviors disappear in favor of open dialogue and mutual affirmation that will encourage the type of change we sorely need in our community for forward progress. <br/>  <br/> If you have any questions about this message or would like additional information  please feel free to call me at 703-821-8833. <br/>  <br/> Monte Skall <br/> National Capital Lyme & Tick-Borne Disease Association <br/>   <br/>   [ 14.

You're on therapy  which is fabulous.  It's the hardest thing not to focus on our own problems  but I feel a bit better when I think about other people and get my mind off how sick I am.   <br/>  <br/> Let me know if you have more questions at all!

3084.702083,yes,no,2890,91678,2363,0,0,0, I have had a strange day.  This morning I saw a spider crawling across the keyboard of my computer.  I tried to catch him but he shrunk himself and slid down between the keys.  I waited  and watched  and shook the keyboard till I figured he was senseless ...and he wouldn't come out! All day I watched for him!  Tonight I tried to type and when I paused to think...he would creep out  look around...YES...GO AHEAD AND SAY IT...at ME...and then run back into the keyboard to hide! He is still there!  Well I hope he gets a headache!  He is giving me one! I have also had the dreaded... drop everything day!  The two ice cube trays...NOT ONE...two... That would have been ok...But I didn't find all of the ice!  Florida is hot today...90 degrees plus!  But not hot enough to keep me from stepping barefoot on the ice SEVERAL times before it melted!   Once it melted...that was even more fun!  Slip sliding away!  Yes...I tried to pick it ALL up...but it is hard to see! Then...oh yes...Have you ever dropped a 2 liter bottle of soda?  With no lid on it?  It goes straight down.  If this ever happens to you...let me give you some advise.  Don't try to catch it! I made that mistake today too.  About half way to the floor I caught it.  But I squeezed it too hard in all the excitement.  This caused a bunch of it to shoot straight up into my hair  my face  and all over my shirt.  Then I lost my grip and it slipped again.  I caught it this time with my right hip!  This sent it shooting across the kitchen floor (which at this point was clean and dry due to the ice/water thing)  into the fridge  across the floor  and all over the spices.  But I wouldn't give up!   I pulled it back up to the counter quickly...but it was too quick!  The stupid bottle must of thought I was shaking it!  So... it started foaming out all over the counter.  I grabbed it and tried to get it to the sink while it was wet and still foaming.  I hit the edge of the sink...it flipped and spewed all over the clean dishes in the dish rack.  By the time this was over...I got 1/2 of a cup of soda!!!  (Of course with NO ICE!) The  dropping  thing continued all day...but...nothing too bad. Till the bowl of taco sauce I was using for dip fell out of my hand and hit my leg.  It flipped then too.  When it did it threw taco sauce all over my blood work tests  my little lamp  my wooden table AND my phone!  Oh...not to forget the chair  the carpet  and the foot stool!  My right leg  my left foot and a box of envelopes were also covered. I cleaned it all up...rested...and returned to the computer.  His name is Earl.  He has set up house keeping in my keyboard.  He thinks it is too dangerous around here to come out in the open.  So I went out and caught him a couple of bugs to tempt him to come out. Instead...Daisy  my pet lizzard  ran up and grabbed the bugs and took off. Ever have  one of those days ?     ,27,552,0,Training,Training

I'm prefacing my response with the fact that I am not a doctor  I don't know your history or the medications you are on or the ingredients of the supplements that you took. <br/>  <br/> That said  if the immune booster is strong and working  you may be having a die off/herx type reaction.

3109.931814,yes,no,1979,11387,30,0,0,0,Do you think this die off is lyme or bartonella? Does Bartonella invade the nerve tissue? or is that a Lyme issue? <br/>  <br/> Whenever I take Zhang allicin or coptis I get a major reaction in my head  and rest of the body. It feels as if the brain is swelling up.  <br/>  <br/> I know that the brain feels no pain  so it's either artery  nerves or menges. If it were menges I think I would have a fever and be in the hospital. If it was artery I think the reaction would be localized to my head and I would not for instance feel what feels like inflammation around the rest of my body. This leaves nerves. I have gastroparesis (http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/gastroparesis/index.htm) where my stomach doesn't contract right  probably the reason for me losing 50 lbs. And obviously I would get this from a disorder with the nerves. Your stomach doesn't just stop working when you are 21 so it must be infection. <br/>  <br/> If I take Zhang Allicin or Coptis around the third day I get the episode where my brain feels as if it is swelling. My stomach and throat feel as if they have completely hardened and will not contract. I get what feels like inflammation inside my rib cage. It feels like nerves are on overdrive down my legs and arms. And I just have to lay  like a vegetable  for hours. <br/>  <br/> My greatest symptoms seem to have always been nerve related  panic attacks  in ability to drink caffeine or alcohol  muscle twitching  and now mobility. <br/>  <br/> I think that whatever I have is deeply embedded in the nerve tissue. <br/>  <br/> From your experiences  would you think this is die off from lyme  bartonella or both. I think I have both  but I am trying to gage what I am hitting. I guess you would also have to consider the coptis or the allicin as to what they kill. They are probably strongest against lyme and because of their molecular weight being able to get into the brain. <br/>  <br/> What do you think? <br/>  <br/> Thanks    ,3,20,0.044692737,Training,Training

3129.384025,yes,no,2885,1553,1238,125,0,0,I'm no expert in homeopathy by any means but I am working with the mycoplasma set frome Deseret Bio. I just started it. I didn't ingest the remedy but used the LightWorks to  absorb  it.  <br/>  <br/> I decided to use the 8 points that Dr. W uses. I tested which Noglier frequency to use for each point & the amount of time to do it.  <br/>  <br/> I really got a reaction from it! I've been having flu-like symptoms & fatigue. My impression is that the remedy + the light is teaching my body how to recognize the mycoplasmas so it can learn how to heal from them. <br/>  <br/> Re:  But if you take live cultures of the Scarlet Fever bacteria and add homeopathic Belladonna  absolutely nothing happens!  <br/>  <br/> Maybe it would be better to just take the Scarlet Fever bacteria without the Belladonna remedy (antidote) in order for your body to figure out how to handle it? <br/>  <br/> I may be a bit foolish about this or just ignorant of how it works. <br/>  <br/> Since people were exposed to Lyme with the infrared light - it seems to me the assumption was that our body would figure out how to overcome it. <br/>  <br/> I'm not sure what role the infrared light plays but I think my body is getting ill in increments & healing in between taking the mycoplasma set of remedies. <br/>  <br/> I can feel it. I got worse after taking the remedy with the light  then I started feeling better. I waited 2 days in between treating. I tried it again yesterday & I'm worse again. <br/>  <br/> The set for mycoplasmas has 8 vials in higher to lower dilutions. Hopefully  I will go through all of the remedies & get to the point where my body will be able to work it out to remove the mycoplasma toxins &/or pathogens. <br/>  <br/> This is just my theory as I'm experiencing this. I have used the bobber & it says to NOT take anything to remove or absorb the toxins. I think it would be defeating the purpose of going through it to allow my body to  learn  how to handle the mycoplasmas. <br/>  <br/> The  learning  is taking place by me having flu-like symptoms. As long as I can endure the flu-like symptoms in increments - I'll be able to gradually rid myself of the mycoplasmas. <br/>  <br/> This is what I  feel  like is going on... just my own theory. <br/>  <br/> ----- <br/>  <br/> I also tested that it would be NO GOOD to treat myself in my bed since it has a magnetic mattress pad. Please be aware of this in case you may treat in an area with magnets  EMF  etc. <br/>  <br/> Also  I didn't think to close the door when I was treating myself & my cat jumped on my lap during the mycoplasma treatment. I'm not sure but I hope my cat didn't get dosed with mycoplasmas....  <br/>  <br/> He's been laying around alot today - but cats do that anyway. I'm not sure if he's laying around more than usual. I'll just have to keep observing him. <br/>  <br/> Just something to consider.,1051,14,0.062730627,Training,Training

Think you would need an ounce or more. <br/>  <br/> This is just my opinion and not medical advice. <br/>  <br/> Bea Seibert,2,11,0.071428571,Training,Training

I also have lots of palps and sometimes a fast heart rate  sometimes its just beating very hard.  Had the echo and nothing looked that serious to them.  Guess it is just the Lyme.   <br/>  <br/> Also  sometimes the meds we are on can cause palps and such.  The worse for me was Malarone.  Felt like my heart was going to beat right out of my chest.  <br/>  <br/> People do sometimes get serious heart issues with LD  but mostly I think we just have the annoying ones.  I had one cardiologist mention dysautonomia to me  but he took it very lightly.  I was on medication at the time for my MVP and he even said that it didn't matter if I took the medication or not.  Don't know what that meant.  I did finally have to get off of it because it made my bp too low.   <br/>  <br/> My opinion is that some of this stuff gets better with Lyme treatment and some of it may remain because Lyme caused slight damage to the heart.,41,22,0.038647343,Training,Training

I'm already on antibiotics  and have been for 8 months.  <br/>  <br/> The issue is that I don't have anyone handling my care that knows what they're doing. <br/>  <br/> I had an LLMD (who looked at my positive test from IgeneX  but retested me through Quest - which came back negative) tell me I didn't have Lyme.  <br/>  <br/> Then I had an ID doctor tell me he's never even heard of IgeneX  but if I did have Lyme  three months of antibiotics will cure me.  <br/>  <br/> And finally  the PA at my doc's office said it's not likely I have Lyme because I don't have sore joints. Well  at the time I saw him I didn't. Now I do.  <br/>  <br/> I'm 100% convinced I have a co-infection. I improved so much on my first three months of doxy. I couldn't believe it. <br/>  <br/> Then I switched to Zithromax. Bad idea. I was on it for two weeks and my breathing went CRAZY. I was itchy  night sweats  etc... I've been on Zith before for sinus infections  never did I have reactions like that. <br/>  <br/> So instead of going back to doxy  the doc opted for tetracycline. Over the course of the last three months  my joint/bone/muscle pain is getting increasingly worse  especially shoulders  ribs  back. I'm still having breathing problems. My anxiety is awful. And I sweat all the time. But most of my other symptoms are completely gone  except for maybe during an evil herx.  <br/>  <br/> I just want some relief  like everybody else!!!,20,14,0.060836502,Training,Training

3248.121651,no,no,12500,145069,914,0,3,0,York teen suffers for years before Lyme disease diagnosed <br/>  <br/> KATHY STEVENS The York Dispatch <br/> Article Last Updated: 05/29/2007 10:45:44 AM EDT <br/>  <br/> No one believed her. <br/> They figured she was making it up for one reason or another. <br/>  <br/> She wanted attention. She wanted to skip school. She was lazy. <br/>  <br/> But those things weren't true. Nicole Lecrone wanted help. <br/>  <br/> She wanted the pain to subside  the muscle aches  the sharp stabbing pains in her stomach. <br/>  <br/>  It felt like falling on nails sticking up through a board  like railroad ties   Nicole said.  Doctors would ask on a scale of one to 10 how bad did it (stomach) hurt.  <br/>  <br/> Sometimes she ranked the pain at 22  sometimes 78  but rarely between one and 10. The doctors didn't know what was wrong. She was 12 years old in 2002  but it would be nearly two years before she was diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease. <br/>  <br/> During that time Nicole was smack in the middle of a medical controversy that she and her mother say hindered treatment and cost her years of youth. <br/>  <br/> Lyme is caused by a bacterium  or spirochete  called Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted to humans by infected blacklegged ticks  or deer ticks. <br/>  <br/> Deer carry the ticks from region to region  but the ticks are found in urban  suburban and rural areas on mice  birds and other host animals. <br/> Ticks are tiny and often go undetected. People are instructed to conduct  tick checks  after being outdoors  particularly in high-risk areas such as in tall grass or woods. And health officials remind people to look for a bulls-eye rash associated with Lyme  which is a sure sign of a tick bite. <br/>  <br/> Early detection best: They say early detection is the best defense against developing what some say is  chronic  or  post  Lyme disease. It's a condition that some people like Lecrone living in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions complain of. They say blood tests too often give false negatives and that too many area doctors aren't  Lyme literate.   <br/>  <br/> That claim is more important now than ever as cases of Lyme increase. Pennsylvania ranks third in the nation for its rate of Lyme disease  with the most cases reported in the southeast region of the state. <br/>  <br/> Still  the majority of researchers and infectious disease specialists  and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  say Lyme is easily diagnosed and treated by a three- or four-week dose of oral antibiotics. <br/>  <br/> Doctors say if aches  fever and malaise don't subside  a month-long dose of stronger antibiotics should eradicate the bacteria  or spirochetes  that travel through the bloodstream and settle in organs. <br/>  <br/> The controversy isn't early detection or early treatment  but how to treat Lyme that isn't detected until much later. <br/>  <br/> A minority of doctors push for a long-term course of antibiotics or antimicrobials for chronic Lyme sufferers. But too often  this group of Lyme sufferers are not receiving adequate treatment. <br/>  <br/> So says Dr. Charles Ray Jones  who during his 45-year tenure as a pediatrician has treated at least 10 000 children. <br/>  <br/> Expert by default: Jones is known internationally as a Lyme specialist  a title he obtained by default in the late 1960s after he and his wife  Margery  moved from New York City to New Haven  Conn. <br/>  <br/>  There were so many children coming in with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis   Jones said during a telephone interview. He later determined that while symptoms were similar  often they stemmed from Lyme disease.  I developed a knack for treating and understanding the disease.  <br/>  <br/> Back then  researchers had only begun to define the disease and related symptoms. The disease was named in 1975 after Old Lyme  Conn.  where researchers saw numerous people with similar symptoms. <br/>  <br/> While Lyme is now widely recognized and tracked by the CDC  it still remains somewhat mysterious. Researchers have not determined exactly when the infection begins  and it affects people differently. Jones says the bacteria can enter the body when the tick bites  or as it attaches. <br/>  <br/> He says the CDC lists two legally accepted standards of care for Lyme: antibiotics or antimicrobials delivered orally or intraveneously. But he says most doctors don't explain or offer both treatments. He recommends patients demand care  and if doctors balk the patient should explain that should the condition worsen  the doctor will be held liable. <br/>  <br/> Incidence up: Appropriate treatment has become more important in recent years as the incidence of Lyme continues to rise  health officials say. In the past decade  the disease has spread west across Pennsylvania. The Health Department recorded 2 589 cases in 1996 statewide compared to 4 042 in 2005. In York County  the 1996 tally was 23 cases; 386 were recorded in 2005. <br/>  <br/> Those numbers made York County the fourth riskiest in the state in 2005 behind Bucks  Montgomery and Chester counties. Chester topped the list at 630 cases of Lyme disease  according to the state health department. <br/>  <br/> The CDC lists Pennsylvania as one of 12 states nationwide that account for 95 percent of reported cases of Lyme; it estimates that incidence rate is 8.2 cases per 100 000 people. <br/>  <br/> Dr. John Manzella  chief of infectious diseases at York Hospital  said treatment is available. As for controversy  he says it stems from known medical practice and guidelines. He agrees with Jones that infused antibiotics are useful when dealing with Lyme if oral therapy fails or if there are central or peripheral nervous system symptoms. <br/>  <br/> But he says there is scant research to support benefits of long-term intraveneous treatment. <br/>  <br/>  There are a number of respected physicians who take a different approach   Manzella said about doctors such as Jones who say long-term treatment is beneficial.  I say  show me the evidence.  <br/>  <br/> False negative possible: He says he's not sure about chronic Lyme  but like Jones  Manzella says the disease can worsen existing conditions. As for diagnosis  Manzella says catching Lyme early is the best defense  that antibiotics most often kill the bacteria. Manzella does say that the blood test  if taken too early  can result in a false negative. <br/>  <br/> That's why Jones recommends relying heavily on clinical diagnosis. Jones said determining whether a person is  cured   that is if all the spirochetes are killed  depends on the elimination of all symptoms for at least two months. <br/>  <br/> That hasn't happened for Nicole. She met Jones in 2004 after testing positive for Lyme. By then  her mom had compiled research on the disease and doctors who  think out of the box   as Jones says.  <br/>  <br/> Nicole and Jennifer made the 270-mile drive from their Spring Grove home to his office. Inside  they saw a 7-by-4-foot corkboard adorned with children's faces  kids from all over the world. There were notes and cards from patients Jones has helped during the years. <br/>  <br/> Then they met him  the 6-foot tall 78-year-old whose professional attire is a two-piece jogging suit. <br/>  <br/> He listened to Nicole's complaints  but it seemed he already knew the problem. <br/>  <br/>  We walked in  and he knew every place that hurt   Nicole said.  It was nice to have a doctor that believed you were sick and not making it up. Other doctors were like  'Oh  it's not Lyme  there's no Lyme around here.' They automatically assumed I was making stuff up.  <br/>  <br/> First trip of many: When Nicole and Jennifer asked about the photographs  Jones told them some of the children's names. He shared their stories and said he'd do his best to help Nicole. That was the first of a dozen or so trips Nicole and Jennifer have made to see Jones. <br/>  <br/> He got in touch with Nicole's physician in York and worked out a treatment plan  which included intraveneous treatment for nine months. The Lecrones' health insurance didn't cover that treatment  but Jennifer and husband Dana Lecrone managed to pay some $30 000 for their daughter's care. <br/>  <br/> They nearly lost their rural home. Dana  a trucker  was gone most of the time  taking as much work as he could get. Backbreaking labor installing fence posts consumed his weekends. Nicole's oldest sister  19-year-old Heather Lecrone  took a part-time job after school so she could buy Nicole's prescription drugs. <br/>  <br/>  We still owe her $6 000   Jennifer said. <br/>  <br/> Friends helped. Bikers held a poker run to raise money for the Lecrones. <br/>  <br/> Kelsey Lecrone  Nicole's 15-year-old sister  says she was scared Nicole would die. <br/>  <br/> Too often she'd seen her sister limp from pain and exhausted from too many sleepless nights. She knew  too  that Nicole told her mom   I want to die. Just let me die.  <br/>  <br/> These days  Nicole's case of Lyme is under control  but her eyes still well with tears when she talks about the worst of times before she was diagnosed  when no one believed her  when her closest friends questioned her. <br/>  <br/> She has good days and bad  but believes now she'll regain her life. <br/>  <br/> Now 17  Nicole says it's about time. Still  she's concerned for others who find themselves in the same predicament  that is  with a disease and the inability to obtain adequate treatment without fighting doctors  insurers and naysayers. <br/>  <br/> She says   It's almost like the president has to get it for something to be done.  <br/>  <br/> Legislation: Three proposals addressing Lyme disease treatments and education remain in state House and Senate committees. House Bill 798 and Senate Bill 722 would establish a task force to study Lyme disease and related maladies. The task force would comprise representatives of the state departments of health  conservation and natural resources  and the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The task force would monitor antibiotic therapies and misconduct proceedings. <br/>  <br/> HB798 was referred March 19 to the Committee on Health and Human Services; SB722 was referred April 2 to Banking and Insurance. A third bill  Senate Bill 573  would provide Lyme disease education  prevention and treatment. <br/>  <br/> Check out this proposed legislation and its status online at  www.legis.state.pa.us.  <br/>  <br/> Tips: May is Lyme Disease Awareness Month in Pennsylvania  primarily because spring marks the beginning of the worst of the tick season. <br/>  <br/> Health-care professionals and entities advise parents that children and adolescents are particularly susceptible to Lyme because of time spent outdoors and in wooded areas. Adults also are advised to take precautions during outdoor activities. <br/>  <br/> Precautions advised include the following: <br/>  <br/> --- Be aware of and avoid tick habitats such as tall grass  bushes  brush and woods. Appropriate clothing for these areas includes long-sleeved shirt  hat and pants tucked into socks or boots. <br/>  <br/> --- Use bug or tick repellent that contains DEET. <br/>  <br/> --- Brush off clothing before going indoors. Once inside  remove and launder clothing; conduct a tick check looking under armpits and near the groin area. <br/>  <br/> --- Remove any unattached ticks; attached ticks may be removed with fine-point tweezers  being careful not to squeeze the body. Grasp the tick where its mouthparts enter the body and tug gently until it releases. <br/>  <br/> --- Save the tick in a covered jar of alcohol labeled with the date and location of where it was believed to have been acquired and contact the state health department. <br/>  <br/> --- Some bites result in an infected rash that resembles a bulls-eye. The expanding  swollen rash appears seven days to one month after the bite. Seek treatment immediately. <br/>  <br/> --- Symptoms most often include fever  chills and muscle aches. Symptoms evident in Lyme-infected children also may include gastrointestinal pain beneath the navel. <br/>  <br/> Sources: The Pennsylvania Department of Health at  www.dsf.health.state.pa.us;  International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society at  www.LymeDiseaseAssociation.org.

You could also have bacterial overgrowth in the intestine from sluggish intestinal movements. If that is the case  than a short course of antibiotics like cipro  falgyl or doxycycline may help.

DNA  detected by a polymerase chain reaction that targeted the outer surface protein A gene  was found in all eight species.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The overall proportion of PCR-positive specimens ranged from 7.8% for I. hexagonus (mostly from mustelids and hedgehogs) to 98.3% for I. uriae (mostly from seabirds).  <br/>  <br/> Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. DNA was found  for the first time in the bat parasite A. vespertilionis (85.3%).  <br/>  <br/> The spirochaete is newly recorded in British populations of I. trianguliceps (97.4%  mostly from voles  mice and shrews)  D. reticulatus (12.5% from dog and man) and R. sanguineus (30% from dogs and human dwellings).  <br/>  <br/> Of the four tick species with larvae available for testing  examples of I. ricinus  I. uriae and A. vespertilionis were PCR positive  as were  <br/> significantly more nymphs than adults of I. ricinus  I. hexagonus and A. vespertilionis.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Analyses showed that B. burgdorferi s.l. has been consistently present in British tick populations since at least 1897.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Ticks positive for B. burgdorferi s.l. DNA were collected in all months of the year  throughout Britain  and were found on a wide range of  <br/> mammal and bird species.  <br/>  <br/> PCR positivity does not prove vector or  <br/> reservoir competence  but the use of archived material has demonstrated an extensive range of host-tick relationships involving B. burgdorferi  <br/> s.l. in Britain for > 100 years.  <br/>  <br/> Publication Types: Historical Article,6,6,0.129113924,Training,Training

3427.283956,no,no,10535,18667,2,0,1,0,MSNBC.com <br/>  <br/> $2.5 billion spent  no alternative cures found <br/> Big  government-funded studies show most work no better than placebos <br/> The Associated Press <br/> updated 12:15 p.m. ET  Wed.  June 10  2009 <br/>  <br/> BETHESDA  Md. - Ten years ago the government set out to test herbal and other alternative health remedies to find the ones that work. After spending $2.5 billion  the disappointing answer seems to be that almost none of them do. <br/>  <br/> Echinacea for colds. Ginkgo biloba for memory. Glucosamine and chondroitin for arthritis. Black cohosh for menopausal hot flashes. Saw palmetto for prostate problems. Shark cartilage for cancer. All proved no better than dummy pills in big studies funded by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. The lone exception: ginger capsules may help chemotherapy nausea. <br/>  <br/> As for therapies  acupuncture has been shown to help certain conditions  and yoga  massage  meditation and other relaxation methods may relieve symptoms like pain  anxiety and fatigue. <br/>  <br/> However  the government also is funding studies of purported energy fields  distance healing and other approaches that have little if any biological plausibility or scientific evidence. <br/>  <br/> Taxpayers are bankrolling studies of whether pressing various spots on your head can help with weight loss  whether brain waves emitted from a special  master  can help break cocaine addiction  and whether wearing magnets can help the painful wrist problem  carpal tunnel syndrome. <br/>  <br/> The acupressure weight-loss technique won a $2 million grant even though a small trial of it on 60 people found no statistically significant benefit ? only an encouraging trend that could have occurred by chance. The researcher says the pilot study was just to see if the technique was feasible. <br/>  <br/>  You expect scientific thinking  at a federal science agency  said R. Barker Bausell  author of  Snake Oil Science  and a research methods expert at the University of Maryland  one of the agency's top-funded research sites.  It's become politically correct to investigate nonsense.  <br/>  <br/> Many scientists say that unconventional treatments hold promise and deserve serious study  but that the federal center needs to be more skeptical and selective. <br/>  <br/>  There's not all the money in the world and you have to choose  what most deserves tax support  said Barrie Cassileth  integrative medicine chief at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. <br/>  <br/>  Many of the studies that have been funded I would not have funded because they seem irrational and foolish ? studies on distant healing by prayer and energy healing  studies that are based on precepts and ideas that are contrary to what is known in terms of human physiology and disease   she said. <br/>  <br/> In an interview last year  shortly after becoming the federal center's new director  Dr. Josephine Briggs said it had a strong research record  and praised the many  big name  scientists who had sought its grants. She conceded there were no big wins from its first decade  other than a study that found acupuncture helped knee arthritis. That finding was called into question when a later  larger study found that sham treatment worked just as well. <br/>  <br/>  The initial studies were driven by some very strong enthusiasms  and now we're learning about how to layer evidence  and to do more basic science before testing a particular supplement in a large trial  said Briggs  who trained at Ivy League schools and has a respected scientific career. <br/>  <br/>  There are a lot of negative studies in conventional medicine   and the government's outlay is small compared to drug company spending  she added. <br/>  <br/> However  critics say that unlike private companies that face bottom-line pressure to abandon a drug that flops  the federal center is reluctant to admit a supplement may lack merit ? despite a strategic plan pledging not to equivocate in the face of negative findings. <br/>  <br/> Echinacea is an example. After a large study by a top virologist found it didn't help colds  its fans said the wrong one of the plant's nine species had been tested. Federal officials agreed that more research was needed  even though they had approved the type used in the study. <br/>  <br/>  There's been a deliberate policy of never saying something doesn't work. It's as though you can only speak in one direction   and say a different version or dose might give different results  said Dr. Stephen Barrett  a retired physician who runs Quackwatch  a web site on medical scams. <br/>  <br/> Critics also say the federal center's research agenda is shaped by an advisory board loaded with alternative medicine practitioners. They account for at least nine of the board's 18 members  as required by its government charter. Many studies they approve for funding are done by alternative therapy providers; grants have gone to board members  too. <br/>  <br/>  It's the fox guarding the chicken coop   said Dr. Joseph Jacobs  who headed the Office of Alternative Medicine  a smaller federal agency that preceded the center's creation.  This is not science  it's ideology on the part of the advocates.  <br/>  <br/> Briggs defended their involvement. <br/>  <br/>  If you're going to do a study on acupuncture  you're going to need acupuncture expertise   she said. These therapists  are very much believers in what they do   not unlike gastroenterologists doing a study of colonoscopy  and good study design can guard against bias  she said. <br/>  <br/> The center was handed a flawed mission  many scientists say. <br/>  <br/> Congress created it after several powerful members claimed health benefits from their own use of alternative medicine and persuaded others that this enormously popular field needed more study. The new center was given $50 million in 1999 (its budget was $122 million last year) and ordered to research unconventional therapies and nostrums that Americans were using to see which ones had merit. <br/>  <br/> That is opposite how other National Institutes of Health agencies work  where scientific evidence or at least plausibility is required to justify studies  and treatments go into wide use after there is evidence they work ? not before. <br/>  <br/>  There's very little basic science behind these things. Most of it begins with a tradition  or personal testimony and people's beliefs  even as a fad. And then pressure comes: 'It's being popular  it's being used  it should be studied.' It turns things upside down   said Dr. Edward Campion  a senior editor who reviews alternative medicine research submitted to the New England Journal of Medicine. <br/>  <br/> That reasoning was used to justify the $2 million weight-loss study  approved in 2007. It will test Tapas acupressure  devised by Tapas Fleming  a California acupuncturist. Use of her trademarked method requires employing people she certifies  and the study needs eight. <br/>  <br/> It involves pressing on specific points on the face and head ? the inner corners of the eyes are two ? while focusing on a problem. Dr. Charles Elder  a Kaiser Permanente physician who runs an herbal and ayurvedic medicine clinic in Portland  Ore.  is testing whether it can prevent dieters from regaining lost weight. <br/>  <br/> Say a person comes home and is tempted by Twinkies on the table. The solution: Start acupressure  and say something like 'I have an uncontrollable Twinkie urge  ' Elder said. Then focus on an opposite thought  like  I'm in control of my eating.  <br/>  <br/> In Chinese medicine  the pressure is said to release natural energy in a place in the body  responsible for transforming animal desire into higher thoughts   Elder said. <br/>  <br/> In a federally funded pilot study  30 dieters who were taught acupressure regained only half a pound six months later  compared with over three pounds for a comparison group of 30 others. However  the study widely missed a key scientific standard for showing that results were not a statistical fluke. <br/>  <br/> The pilot trial was just to see if the technique was feasible  Elder said. The results were good enough for the federal center to grant $2.1 million for a bigger study in 500 people that is under way now. <br/>  <br/> Alternative medicine research also is complicated by the subjective nature of many of the things being studied. Pain  memory  cravings  anxiety and fatigue are symptoms that people tolerate and experience in widely different ways. <br/>  <br/> Take a question like   Does yoga work for back pain?  said Margaret Chesney  a psychologist who is associate director of the federally funded Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland. <br/>  <br/>  What kind of yoga? What kind of back pain?  And what does it mean to  work  ? to help someone avoid surgery  hold a job or need less medication? <br/>  <br/> Some things ? the body meridians that acupuncturists say they follow  or energy forces that healers say they manipulate ? cannot be measured  and many scientists question their existence. <br/>  <br/> Studying herbals is tough because they are not standardized as prescription drugs are required to be. One brand might contain a plant's flowers  another its seeds and another  stems and leaves  in varying amounts. <br/>  <br/> There are 150 makers of black cohosh  and probably no two are exactly the same  and probably some people are putting sawdust in capsules and selling it   said Norman Farnsworth  a federally funded herbal medicine researcher at the University of Illinois at Chicago. <br/>  <br/> Even after a careful study   you know one thing more precise and firm about what that agent did in that population with that outcome measurement  but you don't necessarily know the whole gamut of its effectiveness   as the echinacea study showed  Briggs said. <br/>  <br/> The center posts information on supplements and treatments on its Web site  and has a phone line for the public to ask questions ? even when the answer is that not enough is known to rule in or rule out benefit or harm. <br/>  <br/>  I hope we are building knowledge and at least an informed consumer   Briggs said. <br/> © 2009 The Associated Press.

However  there are a few doctors out there who are learning more.  It is a dangerous thing  though  as their futures can be at risk the more they learn about this.  Very sad  still.    <br/>  <br/> The IDSA is still very vocal about lyme being no big deal.  They still can't read  it seems - and they sure can't see anyone who is truly ill with lyme or TBD. <br/>  <br/> ============= <br/>  <br/> Thanks to TF: <br/>  <br/> a good video that explains the controversy  go to this link:    http://www.kettmann.com/Lyme     <br/>  <br/> It is a tape of a great show on lyme disease done by a Boston TV station a few months ago.  <br/>  <br/> When you get to the site  select the link to view the show. The show was taped by a girl on LymeNet and she put it on-line for all of us to be able to view it.  <br/>  <br/> You will learn a lot about the medical controversy surrounding lyme disease and why it is so hard to find a doctor who knows how to cure a person of lyme disease. <br/>  <br/> ======= <br/>  <br/> These first 3 posts may not mean much but  after you read a bit  you'll see that getting proper diagnosis and treatment has been very difficult for lyme and TBD (tick-borne disease) patients. You might just want to glance a the top three treads to get an idea of what is being done to help change that.  <br/>  <br/> ----------------- <br/> In news  Spring of ?09: <br/>  <br/>  <br/>    http://www.lymedisease.org/news/lymepolicywonk/114.html     <br/>  <br/> Over 1 600 pages of analysis and research studies delivered by ILADS to the IDSA  contesting IDSA recommendations. <br/>  <br/> ------------ <br/>  <br/>    http://www.lymedisease.org/news/lymepolicywonk/115.html     <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) takes IDSA to task <br/>  <br/> ------------ <br/>  <br/>    http://www.lymedisease.org/news/lymepolicywonk/117.html     <br/>  <br/> Germany Says No to IDSA Lyme Guidelines <br/>  <br/> -,4,14,0.044444444,Training,Training

My Eos went down to normal the first 2 X's we treated but then suddenly (along with colon inflammation and other gut symptoms) went up a few months after my last 2 week course of albenza. <br/>  <br/> We started pulsing treatment with albenza and I could see in my blood tests (I get them every 3 weeks) that after being off albenza for awhile  eos would go up.   <br/>  <br/> I've been through 9 pulses and we are moving to a new drug as soon as the manufacturer has it back in stock.   <br/>  <br/> I have the MTHFR genetic issue that is associated with more difficult parasitic infections so I assume this is partly why we can't seem to get rid of them.  I think I've been infected with parasites for a very long time. <br/>  <br/> I also have allergies which is very common in lyme patients.  At first I thought it was probably related to allergies but after going through the pulsing and tracking my eos  I'm fairly certain it is related to parasites. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Terry,18,13,0.063106796,Training,Training

3525.491484,no,no,1278,52677,283,15,0,0,Dr. Cheney (I guess I can use his name now) does not say an echo is worthless in general -- he's talking particularly about what happens in CFS/CFIDS patients  so it may or may not apply to Lyme. <br/>  <br/> What Cheney did find was that CFIDS patients had normal echos until they were done in an upright position  and then they were grossly abnormal (i.e. I think a part of the heart collapsed). <br/>  <br/> He also did tests for PFOs and found that most CFIDS patients have them. <br/>  <br/> Dr. Lerner did 24-hour Holter testing on CFIDS patients and found evidence of cardiomyopathy in most  which he later proved with heart biopsies.   <br/>  <br/> He now sees two subgroups with these abnormal Holters: those with herpesviruses in their hearts  and those with herpesviruses plus a coinfection including Lyme or babesia. <br/>  <br/> But most cardiologists would interpret those tests as normal. <br/>  <br/> Another issue is that more than 50 percent of heart failure (I just read this last night) is now diastolic  which means the ejection fraction on an echo will be normal.   <br/>  <br/> Dr. Cheney found that in CFIDS patients there was not typically edema and the more common symptoms of heart failure  but that they do have diastolic heart failure  many of them.,21,13,0.063636364,Training,Training

3632.523292,yes,no,1015,68518,114,2,0,0,I don't buy that line of thinking. It doesn't apply to healthy people that never get sick  and that's because they have a very strong immune system that squashes the bugs/viruses before they can do any significant amount of damage. I was one of those people before I got slymed by a tick! <br/>  <br/> The reason that people feel tired  exhausted  are coughing up flem  and achy is not because their immune system is working properly  but because of the havoc that the bugs are causing. <br/>  <br/> I believe that most lymies don't catch colds and flu at all  or at least not as often is because their immune systems are in high gear all the time.  Their immune systems can't get rid of the really bad things that are killing them  but it can easily take care of a common cold or flu. <br/>  <br/> Another reason is because of way less exposure to the public  family  and friends. Interaction with other people in public places like School  Church  Movie Shows  and Restaurants is how a lot of people catch things.,9,25,0.032608696,Training,Training

In fact  I'm challenging it to do just that.  In the meantime  I will be trying various thyroid/adrenal regimens in an effort to exact some relief from my symptoms (primarily chronic fatigue and floaters at this point). <br/>  <br/> So if lyme is there...it's going to have to step it up a notch    ,22,16,0.050955414,Training,Training

3681.038721,yes,no,3430,87137,64,11,0,0,The mice were always here  and plentiful. (On this CT farm and surrounding area for the last couple o' centuries.) <br/>  <br/> But no one got lyme until the deer came back.*  So far  studies have shown that eliminating the deer herd is the only way to lower lyme incidence as I posted above.  <br/>  <br/> There's a pretty good biological case for this  But hey  studies can be wrong. (As we know!) <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The communities that have aggressively pursued this option in the areas of highest lyme incidence in the US currently have fewer cases than those in their region who didn't. There is strong science to back this up. <br/>  <br/> It is also more than intuitive to suspect that the animal most out of balance within an eco system would play a role in endemic disease.  <br/>  <br/> That's why foxes  raccoons  and skunks have such a problem with rabies. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> It makes a great deal more sense (to me) to shoot a deer and feed the world  than poison ourselves. **   <br/>  <br/> How healthy can the animals who ate the poisoned mice be? Always remember: You poison your environment  you poison your well (ness.) <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I didn't reach this position easily; because we loved the deer we didn't let the hunters in. Until my 3rd case of lyme...  <br/>  <br/> The first deer harvested had 2000 ticks that we could count  engorged. (About 100 feet from my house.) Who knows how many in the fur unseen.  <br/>  <br/> This level of tick infestation is never observed when the deer are in balance with their environment. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> All that being said  it's a good idea to get rid of the mice. Eradicating mice and deer are not mutually exclusive. <br/>  <br/> Each action helps protect you and your home. But killing a few mice around your house and barn isn't going to really effect the multi thousands living in nearby fields and woods within the deers range. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Certain studies also point to increased animal species biodiversity as playing a role in lyme control.  <br/>  <br/> That is  the more animals that aren't mice for ticks to feed on  the fewer ticks will carry lyme.  <br/>  <br/> So  some deer may be good. One study showed ticks that fell off deer had one of the lowest rates of lyme (about 15%) <br/>  <br/> Luckily  with US forest land at recent high (750+/- million acres vs. 725+/- million acres in the early 1900's) there is no shortage of little critters to go around. (Especially because these same largely go uneaten by humans for the first time in history.) <br/>  <br/> The problem is that much of this forest is considered  backyard forest  with plenty of deer   but no deer predators. <br/>  <br/> So  responsible eco-management - which poisoning is not - requires humans to fill the predatory void. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Deer aren't dumb. Do you think they'd sit there and graze in front of a wolf's den?  <br/>  <br/> Our houses  at this point have to represent the predator's den.  <br/>  <br/> Shoot some deer around your house and the others quickly learn to graze elsewhere.  <br/>  <br/> This doesn't mean you won't have deer. Just that they have a way of finding places to hang where they won't get shot at. <br/>  <br/>  If that happens to be your backyard  they'll pick up on this. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> * Yes I know people may have been sick with lyme all along and didn't know it. <br/>  <br/> ** Yes  I'm aware of  mad deer disease. ,23,9,0.093442623,Training,Training
3681.564395,yes,no,1083,120900,280,1,0,0,Dear Teresa  <br/>  <br/> I think that's happened with me.  My DXA scan was in the just outside the range of osteoporosis category  after years of taking calcium  magnesium   and Vit D every day. <br/>  <br/> Apparently  Lyme interferes with the THYROID gland--lots of Lymies have chronic low body tempearature  for example  which is an indicator of hypothyroid.  <br/>  <br/> Thyroid controls blood calcium and bone creation/resorbtion.  <br/>  <br/> Ugh. <br/>  <br/> From my research  the only study-PROVEN method of increasing bone density is STRONTIUM  which is dose-dependent.  Meaning  the more you take  the more your bone density will increase--but over a period of years.  You can get strontium over the counter as a food suppliment. <br/>  <br/> The Marshall Protocol has a few individuals who have reversed their bad DXA scan results after 2-3 years on the MP.  This is from personal testimonies there. <br/>  <br/> Other methods  like FosiMax oral  actually aren't very effective  but are very costly. <br/>  <br/> Hope this helps. <br/>  <br/> Best  <br/>  <br/> Cass A,8,7,0.11627907,Training,Training

Get more doxy so that you are never without it until you get to a lyme doc.  You may have to go to a walk-in clinic and show the picture  etc. <br/>  <br/> Each place will only give you 200 mg per day  so you need to get pills from 2 sources to get a high enough dose.  (Medical profession in general believes that 200 mg is all a person needs--wrong.) <br/>  <br/> Take the doxy with food or it will really upset your stomach. <br/>  <br/> Also  try to talk them into giving you 30 days worth by emphasizing how sick you have felt ever since the bite.  (Medical profession in general thinks 10-14 days of doxy is enough  but some docs will give you that amount twice=30 days.) <br/>  <br/> You can get yeast in your mouth and intestines from this level of doxy  so go to the health food store and buy some refrigerated probiotics  the expensive kind.  They are the only ones that are any good.  Take them at least 2 hours after you take the doxy (so the doxy doesn't kill them).  Take them 2-3 times per day  two at a time. <br/>  <br/> Avoid eating sugar which feeds yeast.   <br/>  <br/> If your tongue gets a white coating  you know you have yeast in your mouth.  Read what Burrascano says to get rid of it. <br/>  <br/> Absolutely no alcohol per Burrascano.  Alcohol is pure sugar and it also weakens the immune system and is hard on the liver. <br/>  <br/> You need to strengthen your immune system to fight off the diseases the tick gave you.  So  don't do anything to weaken it.  You probably got more than lyme disease from the tick bite. <br/>  <br/> Be sure you read about the other infections (called coinfections) in the Burrascano document.  Each of these diseases needs treated separately by a lyme doc.   <br/>  <br/> Notice that Burrascano says that coinfections are virtually universal (p. 4:   A huge body of research and clinical experience has demonstrated the nearly universal phenomenon in chronic Lyme patients of co-infection with multiple tick-borne pathogens. ) <br/>  <br/> Here is the list of ABSOLUTE RULES from Burrascano  page 27: <br/>  <br/> CERTAIN ABSOLUTE RULES MUST BE FOLLOWED IF LYME SYMPTOMS ARE TO BE PERMANENTLY <br/> CLEARED: <br/> 1.

When I became very sick I told the doctor about the tick and he laughed saying there is no lyme disease in Montana.  2 years later I was researching chronic fatigue online and it kept coming up with lyme connections.  So I searched  lyme disease in Montana  and an article from a local newspaper came up which had been saved by the Can.Lyme site.  It said there is a  cousin  to lyme disease here.  In 2004 the state asked people bitten by ticks to take them to the health dept where they were sent to Rocky MT Lab in Hamilton  a few miles from where I live. <br/> 345 ticks were collected.  6 people developed the rash.  I called the state epidemiologist and he told me this strain does not test. <br/> I have since found out I also got BLO from the tick.  So it is absolutely true that wood ticks carry lyme.

3785.259619,yes,no,2505,41636,627,10,0,0,Seek  <br/>  <br/> Hang in there. The Flagyl may actually make a big difference. In my opinion it works at least a little on babesia. Hubby only took 1/4 pill for a couple of weeks -- but just that little bit made his headaches and eye pain go away. And then the quinine and clindamycin protocol worked wonders. But in my opinion you need to do that for a minimum of 4 months. <br/>  <br/>  The first time hubby did the quinine and clindamycin protocol he did really well for the first couple of months. Started walking and doing pushups again. Hadn't exercised for a year or two at that point. Unfortunately he started losing ground after the first 2 months.  <br/>  <br/> Then we tried to move on to bartonella treatment with rifampin and things went more downhill. Over the next few years hubby repeated the quinine/clindamycin protocol 2 more times I think. It was a little less effective each time I think. <br/>  <br/> We didn't realize for a long time that his seizure-like episodes are most likely from babesia or the new protozoa found by the F lab. LLMD's kept saying his spells could be from either Lyme or bart or babs but couldn't be more specific. <br/>  <br/> If I was in your shoes I would stick to your doc's protocol for at least 6 months. If you aren't seeing improvement or are still confused as to which infections you have then I would retest with either F lab or Clongen lab based on remaining symptoms and treatment response. <br/>  <br/> If you are herxing from the Doxy then wait a while before adding in artemesinin or anything else. It should be fine to combine the art with the quinine/clindamycin.  <br/>  <br/> Keep a notebook and make notes when you change meds or supplements. Once a week or so list and rate your 5 or 10 worst symptoms on a scale of 1 - 5 or 1 - 10. It will help you stay focused. Some symptoms may improve and others may show up.  <br/>  <br/> It is really better not to force the exercise at this point in my opinion. Hubby initially lost 30 pounds. Took a couple of years to gain that back. Then he gained an extra 25 pounds and was overweight. Lost that plus another 5 pounds when he resumed exercise. Then last year lost 35 pounds again -- has only managed to gain 20 pounds back.  <br/>  <br/> Exercise tolerance definitely seems to come and go for hubby. And it does seem to be somewhat tied in to babs treatment although not totally.  <br/>  <br/> This is not medical advice  just my opinion based on hubby's experiences. <br/>  <br/> Bea Seibert,20,19,0.047826087,Training,Training

I feel somedays will die if dont leave here. <br/>  <br/> I am raised Catholic  but have not practiced it  for long time  I became well enough to go to church about 1 month ago during the week in early AM for short mass  and had confession and the sacrement of the Anointing of the sick  <br/>  <br/> and felt that it REALLY helped me  it was like some little gift to my mind  and my body  and I felt so much better in ways  then I came here  to home  and started to feel sicker  as the weeks went on  I am now sick again and too sick to go to church  <br/>  <br/> but hopefully will go again  because it helped me  and that is good. <br/>  <br/> I could not believe how peacefull I felt  after I went to church  I was not expecting this to happen  and the Sacrement the priest gave me  the Annointing of the Sick well  about 1 day later  it was incredible the peace I felt  it was something I need to feel to get well   <br/>  <br/> So please pray that I will get well enough to move on my own. I have developed hate living here and that is NOT who I am  I hate  because of being hurt and it is not something I want to feel  I want peace. I will try every avenue to get well  and this Church avenue has worked  so it is with me for life.   <br/>  <br/> I also want to say  that it is not always bad living here  sometimes it is good  but there hurtful days that are very stressful to me  and sometimes  no matter what you say  they just will never get this illness  I have tried  and I know that it is best for me and for them  that I go on my own.  <br/>  <br/> thanks        <br/>  <br/> Trish <br/>   <br/>   [ 21.

How long can we see results...  <br/>  <br/> That all depends on how many electromagnetic patterns they find in your body that causes your body to make mistakes.  The average Lymie so far has an average of 30 blockages of one sort or another.  All of them work together to keep the body from recognizing toxins for what they are and to defend itself the way it is expected to do. <br/> Many of us have lost the ability to do that. <br/>  <br/> Some people do 1 cycle of drops for 14 days  some people need 3  some people need 5 and more.  They will search until you either have no more symptoms or they can no longer find any irregularity.  <br/>  <br/> Waiting is not going to change anything.  The longer the irregulars persist  the road blockages in the regulation cycle  the longer it takes to correct them  because the body is hard at work and can only do a few at a time.  Section by section of the roadway is being cleared.   <br/>  <br/> They find and we discovered that many dysfunctions (allergies) are inherited.  The sad part is that many children today are born with them.  My son is already starting treatment and I am sure the rest of the family will follow.   <br/>  <br/> Take care. <br/>  <br/> ... and please quit swallowing or rubbing in nosodes!  It worries me  especially your child.   Remember Lymerix  the vaccine.  You can put the wrong nosodes on your body for photons that you do not need and it will cause no illness.  Swallowing and rubbing them in what you have already or don't have already is a different story.  I have heard horror stories of nosode and vaccine manufacturing and would not take a chance with ingesting.  All Lymies I know  <br/> who have taken the AI test are allergic at the DNA level to a series of fungi/molds  without exception.  The body has forgotten what to do with it.,38,21,0.042735043,Training,Training

Because I really want to play. <br/>  <br/> Actually  that brings me to what I was going to say  I talked to my favorite teacher today who is one of the coaches. I told her I didn't know if I was going to try-out.  <br/>  <br/> She said 'Why not'(cuz she really wants me to  I am one of her fave students!)  <br/>  <br/> And I told her everything. I noticed what she was typing and when I mentioned my heart thing she was like that is what I was just writing.  <br/>  <br/> Apparently she has a heart problem. I didn't know that! She misses a lot of school and stuff and I always wondered if she had something wrong with her. I just wonder what now. But  she understodd what I was saying. <br/>  <br/> She said I could go play and if I start not feeling good or anything (a huge list of symptoms she said!) I could stop and sit down. No biggy.  <br/>  <br/> So she understands. That's good. But  I think I am going to go watch but not try-out this year. I will next year. If I can.

The bill will now proceed to the Senate for consideration. <br/>    <br/> H.B. 6200 contains language that will protect CT licensed Lyme treating physicians from prosecution by the State of Connecticut Medical Examining Board solely on the basis of a clinical diagnosis and /or for treatment of long-term Lyme disease. <br/>    <br/> The bill provides the definition for Lyme disease which includes   ?the presence in a patient of signs and symptoms compatible with acute infection with Borrelia burgdorferi; or with late stage or persistent or chronic infection with Borrelia burgdorferi  or with complications related to such an infection.? <br/>    <br/> It also defines clinical diagnosis as determined by a physician ??that is based on knowledge obtained through the medical history and physical examination alone  or in conjunction with the testing that provides supportive data for such clinical diagnosis.?   <br/>  <br/> In addition  it provides for updating the definition if other strains are found to cause Lyme disease. <br/>  <br/> The final bill was the result of months of negotiations between Legislative leaders  the Connecticut Department of Public Health and the undersigned groups representing patients. <br/>    <br/> We would like to thank Representatives Jason Bartlett  Kim Fawcett  Chris Lyddy   Peggy Reeves and all of the legislators who supported this bill.  <br/>   <br/> We would also like to thank the Legislative leadership for taking time from their busy schedules to meet with us over the past several weeks.   <br/>  <br/> We particularly thank the joint Public Health Committee Chairs  Representative Betsy Ritter and Senator Jonathan Harris and the Public Health Committee for understanding this complex issue and its importance to patients in CT. <br/>  <br/> We would like to extend our appreciation to the patients  families and members of the Lyme community who wrote letters  made phone calls and testified in support of H.B. 6200. <br/>  <br/> We have confidence that the Connecticut Senate will fulfill its commitment to CT residents and pass this important piece of legislation intact. <br/>  <br/> For updates and wording on the bill  please go to <br/>  <br/>   http://www.cga.ct.gov/  <br/>  <br/> Lyme Disease Association  Inc. <br/>  <br/> Newtown Lyme Disease Task Force <br/>  <br/> Ridgefield  Lyme Disease Task Force <br/>  <br/> Time For Lyme  Inc. <br/>  <br/> Eastern Connecticut Chapter Lyme Disease Association,16,10,0.087336245,Training,Training

It is a new Patton  economy type heater.  <br/>  <br/>      TxC' turned the switch off but the outlet didn't cool down for some time. Heater was on from 8:30 to about 9:30. Outlet was still warm to the touch in center section at noon.  <br/>  <br/> We plug it directly in to wall socket.I don't trust the electrical around here and don't want it on if we are not in sight of the heater. <br/>  <br/>      As to the heater landlord didn't suggest it  he just said keep the heat turned up... so I'd like to know if he'll help w/ the bill. <br/>  <br/>     I am used to using sweaters/sweatshirts and afghans  when TxC is at work. But Landlord tho't the place was too chilly. <br/>  <br/>      Now we know that prices are high all over for heating. Dad has to pay over a $1000 to fill his oil heat tank in Seattle area.  <br/>  <br/> So he didn't fill it all only partly this year  but uses a small space heater.[House isn't in very good shape  so when dad goes it'll be torn down most likely]. <br/>  <br/> And he uses the electric heat he installed in the Bathroom for bath and his room. So far no frozen pipes. <br/>  <br/>      It saddens me  to see costs go so high all over the place. Seems anything to help keep a reasonable temperature is costly now.  <br/>  <br/>       I find myself wondering how hot the outlet was by our little AC  window unit this summer. We had the living area curtained off for some cooling. <br/>  <br/>      Those of you who pray please keep us and our angels in mind [I'm sure they are working way beyond overtime!!!]  as we try to find a safe place for ourselves and our two dogs to live! <br/>  <br/>      Will continue to update as we find more info' <br/>  <br/>        Jus' The Silverwolf who doesn't want my fur fried.,22,11,0.080786026,Training,Training

Then  you can forget about this disease and live your life. <br/>  <br/> It is like finishing college.  Go back and finish your lyme treatment so that you never get any worse  OK? <br/>  <br/> The symptoms you have aren't normal.  Get yourself back to normal so you can have a normal life.

4279.599707,yes,no,1024,67205,1207,1,0,0,I also wish I knew if my fatigue was due to the TBDs or secondary factors. Either way  I think recovering from the TBDs will help. <br/>  <br/> I suppose it could be our bodies being super-depleted from fighting this  and ingesting all these meds. I tend to think strengthening the mitochondria is a good idea  but that is just a personal hunch and not based in anything. <br/>  <br/> I tried a supplement called Mitochondrial Resusitate by Metagenics  and it did help slightly. That product is similar to NT Factor  which I haven't tried yet.  <br/>  <br/> I have heard good things also about D-Ribose and L-Carnitine....which I am considered ordering from iherb.com  once I get my prescriptions figured out. <br/>  <br/> Some people blame hormones. I have taken thyroid meds and they didn't help me  but I haven't investigated the adrenals thing yet.  <br/>  <br/> Right now I'm just banking on treating the TBDs helping me  because in the past the fatigue got a little better when my TBD treatment was working out for me.,3,15,0.056497175,Training,Training

4296.20099,yes,no,2415,96317,2,0,0,0,I thought as a new member and someone who just learned in the last 30 days that I have had Lyme for over 3 years  that I would share a little something with you. I have only made 4 close friends my whole life. Ten years ago  I lost one of those very dear friends to breast cancer. She was only in her early 40's. A year and a half later  I lost a second close friend to breast cancer. She was in her early 50's. Less than a year later  I found out that a third friend of mine also had breast cancer.  Shortly after that  I found a lump in my right breast. In 2003 I had surgery to remove it  and was told that my lumpectomy was free of cancer. Although I was relieved that it was not cancer  I was confused. I thought I had found the reason for all the symptoms I had. I was sure it had to be cancer. Back to the doctor I went. I was told I had Hep B. Lovely. I blamed my husband. Thought he cheated. Then I blamed the blood transfusion I had when my daughter was born by C-section back in 1987. In October of this year  I found another lump. It grew in the same spot the last one was removed. I was sure it was cancer and that they missed it the first time and that it grew back. I thought the time had finally come and I was going to hear those dreadful words. My lumpectomy was .....free of cancer. Back to the doctor again. More blood tests  etc. A week before Thanksgiving  my doctor called. I was told that I tested positive for Lyme. A second test proved this to be a fact. Well  now I had my answer. I freaked. I bawled. I cried for days. On Thanksgiving day of this year I spoke with the husband of my third friend who was diagnosed with cancer back in 2001. They were supposed to go to their newly married daughter's first Thanksgiving dinner. She was too ill to go. Too tired she said. Her husband carried her up to bed. She slept all day. She slept most of the next day as well. Then  at 5:30 a.m. two days after Thanksgiving  my friend Sue died of breast cancer. Am I upset that I have Lyme? Nah. I have been Blessed. Life won't be a bowl of cherries for me I am sure. I have some really bad days. But given what I have seen my 3 friends go through  I'll take the Lyme  thank you. As for my 4th friend......she has had M.S. since we were 15. She is in pain all the time  can't keep her balance and needs a walker now. She is only 51. Yes  I am blessed. Just thought I would share.

I got this then  and since he was a die-hard baseball fan; i took it to the nursing home and read it to him.    i had such excitement in it as i read it to him; dad hung to every word  and wiped a tear from his eye as i finished!    that was the day he told me when i read things/sports i liven things up to make it enjoyable for those listening to me!   i wasn't monitone like my brother-in-law who read sports for dad!  this brought memories of my reading this aloud to dad that day.      <br/>   <br/> I had a 3  folder of good stories like this   so i left them for their nursing home activity director;  she was going to read them here and there.   she told me she sat in her office belly laughing at so many of them during stress time!  bettyg <br/>     <br/> At a fundraising  dinner for a school that serves learning-disabled children  the father of  one of the students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all  who attended. After extolling the school and its dedicated staff  he offered  a question:  When not interfered with by outside influences  everything  nature does is done with perfection. Yet my son  Shay  cannot learn things  as other children do He cannot understand things as other children do.  Where is the natural order of things in my son?   <br/>    <br/> The audience was  stilled by the query.  <br/>    <br/> The father continued.  I believe that when a  child like Shay  physically and mentally handicapped comes into the world   an opportunity to realize true human nature presents itself  and it comes in  the way other people treat that child.   <br/>    <br/> Then he told the following  story:  <br/>    <br/> Shay and his father had walked past a park where some boys  Shay knew were playing baseball. Shay asked   Do you think they'll let me  play?  Shay's father knew that most of the boys would not want someone like  Shay on their team  but the father also understood that if his son were  allowed to play  it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging and some  confidence to be accepted by others in spite of his handicaps  <br/>    <br/> Shay's  father approached one of the boys on the field and asked (not expecting  much) if Shay could play. The boy looked around for guidance and said    We're losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning. I guess he  can be on our team and we'll try to put him in to bat in the ninth  inning.   <br/>    <br/> Shay struggled over to the team's bench and  with a broad  smile  put on a team shirt. His Father watched with a small tear in his eye  and warmth in his heart. The boys saw the father's joy at his son being  accepted.  <br/>   <br/> In the bottom of the eighth inning  Shay's team scored a few runs  but was still behind by three. In the top of the ninth inning  Shay put on a  glove and played in the right field.  <br/>   <br/> Even though no hits came his way  he  was obviously ecstatic just to be in the game and on the field  grinning  from ear to ear as his father waved to him from the stands. In the bottom of  the ninth inning  Shay's team scored again. Now  with two outs and the bases  loaded  the potential winning run was on base and Shay was scheduled to be  next at bat.  <br/>    <br/>    <br/>    <br/> At this juncture  do they let Shay bat and give  away their chance to win the game? Surprisingly  Shay was given the bat.   <br/>   <br/> Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible because Shay didn't even  know how to hold the bat properly  much less connect with the ball.    <br/>    <br/> However  as Shay stepped up to the plate  the  pitcher  recognizing that the other team was putting winning aside for this  moment in Shay's life  moved in a few steps to lob the ball in softly so  Shay could at least make contact.  <br/>   <br/> The first pitch came and Shay swung  clumsily and missed. The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the  ball softly towards Shay. As the pitch came in  Shay swung at the ball and  hit a slow ground ball right back to the pitcher.  <br/>  <br/> The game would now be  over. The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could have easily thrown  the ball to the first baseman. Shay would have been out and that would have  been the end of the game.  <br/>    <br/> Instead  the pitcher threw the ball right  over the first baseman's head  out of reach of all team mates. Everyone from  the stands and both teams started yelling   Shay  run to first! Run to  first!   <br/>   <br/> Never in his life had Shay ever run that far  but he made it to  first base. He scampered down the baseline  wide-eyed and  startled.  <br/>  <br/> Everyone yelled   Run to second  run to second!  Catching  his breath  Shay awkwardly ran towards second  gleaming and struggling to  make it to the base.  <br/>   <br/> By the time Shay rounded towards second base  the right  fielder had the ball ... the smallest guy on their team who now had his  first chance to be the hero for his team.  <br/>   <br/> He could have thrown the ball to  the second-baseman for the tag  but he understood the pitcher's intentions  so he  too  intentionally threw the ball high and far over the  third-baseman's head.  <br/>   <br/> Shay ran toward third base deliriously as the runners  ahead of him circled the bases toward home.  <br/>    <br/> All were screaming    Shay  Shay  Shay  all the Way Shay   <br/>    <br/> Shay reached third base because  the opposing shortstop ran to help him by turning him in the direction of  third base  and shouted   Run to third! Shay  run to third!   <br/>    <br/> As Shay  rounded third  the boys from both teams  and the spectators  were on their  feet screaming   Shay  run home! Run home!   <br/>   <br/> Shay ran to home  stepped on the  plate  and was cheered as the hero who hit the grand slam and won the game  for his team.  <br/>    <br/>  That day   said the father softly with tears now  rolling down his face   the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of  true love and humanity into this world .  <br/>    <br/> Shay didn't make it to  another summer. He died that winter  having never forgotten being the hero  and making his father so happy  and coming home and seeing his Mother tearfully embrace her little hero of the day!  <br/>    <br/> A wise man once said every society is judged by how it  treats it's least fortunate amongst them.    <br/>      <br/> May your day  be a  Shay  Day.  <br/> **************************************** <br/> YOU KNOW YOU ARE LIVING IN 2007 when...  <br/>  <br/> 1.

We never would have found Adam in the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning.  <br/>  <br/> Scoutmaster Keith got mad at Adam for going on a hike alone without telling anyone. Adam said he did tell him  but it was during the fire so he probably didn't hear him.  <br/>  <br/> Did you know that if you put gas on a fire  the gas will blow up?  The wet wood didn't burn  but one of the tents did and also some  of our clothes. Matthew is going to look weird until his hair grows  back.  <br/>   <br/>  We will be home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Keith gets the bus fixed.  It wasn't his fault about the wreck. The brakes worked okay when we left.  <br/>  <br/> Scoutmaster Keith said that with a bus that old you have to  expect some things to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance.  <br/>  <br/> We think it's a neat bus. He doesn't care if we get it dirty  and if it's hot  sometimes he lets us ride on the fenders. It gets pretty hot with 45 people in a bus. He let us take turns riding in the trailer  until the highway patrol man stopped and talked to us.  <br/>  <br/> Scoutmaster Keith is a neat guy. Don't worry  he's a good driver. In fact  he is teaching Jesse how to drive on the mountain  roads  <br/> where there isn't any traffic. All we ever see up there are logging  trucks.  <br/>  <br/> This morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the lake. Scoutmaster Keith wouldn't let me because I  <br/> can't swim  and Adam was afraid he would sink because of his cast  so he  let  us take the canoe across the lake. It was great. You can still see  some of the trees under the water from the flood.  <br/>  <br/> Scoutmaster Keith isn't crabby like some Scoutmasters. He  didn't even get mad about us not wearing life jackets.  <br/>  <br/> He has to spend a lot of time working on the bus so we are trying  not to cause him any trouble.  <br/>  <br/> Guess what? We have all passed our first aid merit badges.  When Andrew dived into the lake and cut his arm  we got to see how a  <br/> tourniquet works.  <br/>  <br/> Steven and I threw up  but Scoutmaster Keith said it probably  was just food poisoning from the leftover chicken.  He said they got sick that way with food they ate in prison.  <br/>  <br/> I'm so glad he got out and  became our Scoutmaster. He said he sure figured out how to get things done better while he was doing his time.  <br/>  <br/>  I have to go now. We are going to town to mail our letters  and buy some more beer. Don't worry about anything.  We are fine.  <br/> Love    Chris     <br/> **************,354,11,0.080159433,Training,Training

4304.575166,yes,no,7701,42702,629,6,3,0,I trekked up to Philly last Monday night to see the film.  Let me start by saying that the film festival ran from March 26 ? April 6 and featured <br/>  <br/> over 130 films.  The people who were at Lymelife where not necessarily  there to see that film.  It was the last night of the Festival and that is the night that all of the awards are given out  <br/>  <br/> and a good 40 minutes were spent on that alone before the film began.  The movie was sold out. There was not one empty seat in the house. <br/>  <br/> I read the above review on Wednesday in the NYT and I also observed a good sized advertisement for the movie?s opening in NYC next to the article describing it as ?Purely Hilarious?  among other descriptions. <br/>  <br/> Here is also a previous link about the film before it was released: <br/>            http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi/topic/1/78117?#000000            <br/>  <br/> When the movie was over I asked a woman sitting next to me if she knew anything about Lyme disease. She said no  but she had a friend who had that bell?s face thing.  I asked how she thought the subject of Lyme was portrayed and the character who had it (Hutton) and her reply was ?like a joke?. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> While I fully understand this movie was not a movie about Lyme disease it uses the name of the illness in its title and has a central character in the movie that is ill with the disease.  That character is portrayed basically as someone who <br/>  <br/> is crazy  losing his grip on reality and every time he eyes a deer in the woods or on the property the audience laughed.  There is no sympathy shown toward this man at all.  He is totally ignored by his family and everyone in the <br/>  <br/> movie. He lives in total isolation  getting sicker and further removed from reality.  His life is being destroyed and no one cares nor does the audience understand what is happening to him.  <br/> He is portrayed as a weirdo. <br/>  <br/> I would suggest that everyone see this film and come to their own conclusion about it.   Everyone will feel differently.  Having lived and almost died from this illness  I didn?t appreciate the  <br/>  <br/> very casual approach to the illness nor the title.  I wonder if they would make a film of this nature called ?Cancerlife?.unlikely. <br/>  <br/> The review says it?s about two dysfunctional families. One is definitely dysfunctional  the other family is one where one individual is  <br/>  <br/> battling a serious illness and no one cares?.I guess you could call that dysfunctional but it misses the real point. <br/>  <br/> At the end of the movie there was a Q&A with Rory Culkin and one of the screen writers  I believe Steven Martini.  Unfortunately  Madge could not be there for that.   I waited a long while to ask my question because I wanted to hear what  <br/>  <br/> questions the audience would ask. After  <br/> about maybe ten questions  not one of which were about Lyme or about the character who had it  his behavior  etc.  I asked mine.  I gave the whole nine yards.  Explained how long I had been sick  <br/>  <br/> with the illness  what it did to my life  how serious it is  how it is an epidemic  how people can?t get treatment  go misdiagnosed  how it?s a political disease  etc. and then asked given all  <br/>  <br/> that how they came upon the title of the film and how they thought the way they portrayed Hutton would be interpreted by those who had no understanding of the illness and by those who did. <br/>  <br/> I got the company line   sort of like when I called ?Time for Lyme? to ask why they were honoring this film and cast at their gala (discussed in the above link).  The screen writer who did take his time to answer said <br/>  <br/> they worked over a few versions  couldn?t really figure out how to put the facts about the illness into the story without weighing it down and getting technical and it was the seventies before Lyme was really on the scene etc. <br/>  <br/> I also pointed out that I was aware that the cast would be honored at the  Time for Lyme  gala.  With that a woman  and I don't know who she was  got <br/>  <br/> on the stage and pointed out that Lyme organizations were embracing the film because it was bringing about lyme awareness. <br/>  <br/> I don't believe that to be true after seeing the Film.  I believe it was a defensive response on her part in response to my question which they probably did not expect. I believe we can use this film to bring about Lyme awareness. <br/>  <br/> But it was clear to ME from the film that all the characters knew ticks were dangerous as illustrated by Rory Culkin?s mother taping a hat <br/>  <br/> to his head when he was bitten by a tick on the neck  while the audience laughed and Culkin not telling his mother for an extended length of  <br/> time that he had been bitten.  Hutton removed the  <br/>  <br/> tick for him.  The film constantly zeroed in on this cute little deer in the front yard while Hutton would look at it like a deranged person   sometimes aiming a rifle at it and the audience <br/>  <br/> laughed  flashes of medicine bottles and Hutton using pictures of deer nailed to trees in the woods for target practice  again the audience laughing.  <br/>  <br/> For the cognoscenti  like us  when we see the film we get it.  The ordinary person who has no understanding of this illness will not.  They see Hutton as a odd ball weirdo but have no idea what he is up against. <br/>  <br/> The film writers also knew about all the issues relating to Lyme and they expressed this when they replied to my question.  However  they are in the entertainment business  sadly we are not  we are suffering. <br/>  <br/> Hutton had been diagnosed with Lyme.  There was no uncertainly about what was wrong with him whether it was the l970's or 2009.  He was seriously ill. <br/>  <br/> I might also add that after my question  not one other person in the audience asked any questions about Lyme disease or about the character who had it. <br/>  <br/> Similarly  I have read quite a few reviews of this movie and given that it is 2009 some reviewers have reviewed it from the point of view <br/>  <br/> with some knowledge about lyme when referencing  Hutton.  That is good for us  for those who do read the reviews  but still the Lyme issue is mostly a little understood sideline in the movie <br/>  <br/> that produces more laughs than sympathy.  In fact  as I have already stated there is no sympathy for Hutton at all.  Here is a compilation of recent reviews: <br/>  <br/>  http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lymelife/  <br/>  <br/> What I strongly feel is that this film is an opportunity for the Lyme Community to bring about Lyme awareness but the film will not do it except in rare cases where a curious individual will  <br/>  <br/> delve deeper.  People are going to see this film for the cast and to be entertained. <br/>  ?Time for Lyme? was smart. They knew having the <br/>  <br/>  cast there would bring in $$$.  That group has always been good at that and I give them credit to use it for their advantage.         http://timeforlyme.org/index.html        <br/>  <br/> But we must organize and I mean organize a real effort to be at every theatre where this film is being played to be out front giving out literature to educate the public about:  <br/>  <br/> LYME DISEASE AND ITS CO-INFECTIONS and the IDSA! <br/>  <br/> People will not leave this film with Lyme awareness. Quite the contrary many will come out laughing about it. <br/>  <br/> HOW DO WE GO ABOUT DOING THIS?  THIS IS A SUBJECT FOR ACTIVISM ON A LARGE SCALE. <br/>   <br/>   [ 04-11-2009  11:41 AM: Message edited by: Abxnomore ] ,22,14,0.063907044,Training,Training

I bought the Lightworks figuring that for $300 I could see if light really does something and knowing that I could not do the whole protocol that Dr. W uses. <br/>  <br/> Once I started using the Lightworks  I realized it did a lot.  I stopped using it (I didn't know if it was doing good or bad for me) and scheduled the trip to Germany.   <br/>  <br/> We continue to use the Lightworks on our bird who is old and had one foot in the grave.  She is doing well and looks like a young bird again the way she dances around.  The protruding abdomen is gone.   <br/>  <br/> Mati  I do understand your predicament and don't judge you at all!

4326.419838,yes,no,1544,15847,82,235,0,0,HI Hiker53 & All <br/>  <br/> Just to give an update  I spoke to Robert at Progurt last night and he told me to pour a sachet into my mouth and then drink some water to wash it down  then drink a glass of water 15mins later.  <br/>   <br/> Previously Ive been empyting one sachet into a large glass of water and drinking it all at once. I tried the way he suggested today and it is doable but it is a bit tricky too because the powder ends up getting stuck in your throat and up your nose making you cough before you're able to down the water!! I'm not sure why he suggested taking it that way and I didnt have a chance to ask him last night as it was very late. <br/>  <br/> Ive been taking the sachets (one a day) since Friday bar one day and as far as my reactions  Ive been having more bowel movements and I think I have more energy too which is good news... eg this morning I had more strength than usual  esp  in my legs which did feel unusual (I am in stage 5-6 adrenal exhaustion).  Progurt is the only new thing I'm taking at the moment so I'm pretty sure its down to that...Ive even stopped taking my thyroid meds to see the effects of the Progurt.  <br/>  <br/> I think that it is stirring up candida & mercury too as Ive also been feeling more toxic in my head aswell  sometimes severely so tho I am not sure if that is completely down to the progurt.    <br/>  <br/> So overall I definitely feel its doing something significant and will stick with it and will try making the liquid when my incubator arrives. <br/>  <br/> Take care,288,22,0.04,Training,Training

For me  I know flourescent lighting plays a big part.  In doctor's offices I have to always ask if I can close their blinds and usually hold a magazine to shade eyes from the lighting because with sunglasses  can't make eye contact. Any big store-Target  etc. and my symptoms return within minutes.  Disoriented-blurry vision- stumbling-weakness  etc.  It is awful. So now I never shop--unless I can run in real quick and pick up a pair of socks or something. Terrific info on reasoning behind it-thanks. Grocery stores are not as bad as department stores so chemical sensitivity must play a hugh part. But in  a crowded store-like Whole Foods today  I get all whacked out.

In my case Ricephin mino rifampin or Bicillin  mino  levaquin.  I dont fancy plaquinel. <br/>  <br/>   I will pulse out mino for flagyl for 2 weeks whilst on the levaquin to cover cysts.  I also take malarone but not for much longer.  The flare up I thought was babs was under treated Bart. <br/>  <br/> You really have to use higher doses to make a real difference. Mino 400mg levaquin 750mg rifampin 1200mg. I really have to dose rifampin 900mg or more for the Bart in the eyes. <br/>  <br/>  Again I am talking for myself who is defo a classic lyme and Bart nightmare.  I think the rifampin maybe hits strains of bart that levaquin does not.  Either way it works really well for me. <br/>  <br/>   Like I said I have been in a bad way the last few weeks but thats because I took a wrong turn on treatment in January(bactrim +zithro for Bart was useless for me). <br/>  <br/>   You learn so much from your mistakes but they are so costly time wise. <br/>  <br/> I have been at this 2 years and I am only now finding my magic combos.

Thanks so much for the post.  Very interesting.    <br/>  <br/> on another note: <br/> ------------- <br/>  <br/> I've been working on compiling information on SCD for a while and finally got it together.  <br/>  <br/> In case this helps anyone else - many have gone for years never knowing this had a name.    <br/>  <br/> In my research  I have found one or two references to lyme being one possible cause of  of connection to  this  although it is most likely congential and  if present  just does not usually show up until adulthood.  Trauma  too  can bring it out. <br/>  <br/> If lyme (or other infections) are eating away at bone  of course  until the underlying cause is addressed surgery would be a stop-gap - or relief time and less stress on the body so healing from lyme could really happen.   <br/>  <br/> Some patients (as in the video) do quite well with surgery.  Others take longer to heal and vertigo can be further challenged. <br/>  <br/> There are many surgeons in the country / world who do this  but it's only been identified since 1995 and the main research and surgical team is at Johns Hopkins.   From what I've read  they are quite impressive and have had zero cases of deafness from the (approx. 70) surgeries performed there. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ======================================= <br/> ======================================= <br/>  <br/> Superior Canal Dehiscence  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6vAkdGw8T4          <br/>  <br/> SCDS ?

Hyperacusis can have many causes  but lyme is certainly one of those.    Many SCD patients have hyperacusis but only a few hyperacusis patients have SCD. <br/>  <br/> Many patients with lyme who experienced hyperacusis (or sound-triggered seizures)  found that successful treatment ofr lyme / TBD either diminished or eliminated this horrible symptom. <br/>  <br/>  www.hyperacusis.net/          <br/>  <br/> THE HYPERACUSIS NETWORK (caution: top portion of this web page is a roll of photos  very dizzying) <br/>  <br/>  <br/> - <br/>  <br/> A page on Adrenal Support would be welcome here as anyone with sound sensitivity (or stress from any stimuli) can get pretty crispy around the edges  so to speak. <br/>  <br/> Ashwagandha is my favorite that seems to work for everyone but there are many more. <br/>  <br/> Magnesium helps me tremendously (with attention to B-vitamins  and fish oil  too).   <br/>  <br/> Not all hyperacusis comes directly from the ears.  If it's from the brain or nervous system being too excited or over-stimulated  toxins can be to blame.   Excesss porphryins  too  can be toxic to the ears and create all sorts of sensitivities. <br/>  <br/> Liver support and  again  magnesium can help there.   Good sleep is vital. <br/>  <br/> The post - 2 above -  by Shazdancer  with the link to the perception centers - helps explain a lot.  I found it amusing that this article was published on July 4th  (last week!).    Not the best day of the year for ears! <br/>  <br/>  <br/> - <br/>   <br/>   [ 12.

4454.734712,yes,no,4411,61102,23,63,0,0,I was never properly tested for co-infections. I suspect a bartonella co-infection  given the extremity of symptoms I had  and because I had severe lymph node involvement.  <br/>  <br/> I also suspect that I had ehrlichia  given some of the other symptoms I had. I had an enlarged spleen and liver and some strange rashes that weren't typical Lyme rashes.  <br/>  <br/> If I had babesia at any point  I think it would have been cleared pretty quickly  because I used a lot of eucalyptus oil from the very beginning  and eucalyptus has historically been used as an antimalarial by Australian aborigines.  <br/>  <br/> The essential oils are broad spectrum and can address a variety of types of infections.  <br/>  <br/> They can be antifungal  antiviral  antibacterial. <br/>  <br/> They can be active against mycoplasmas.  <br/>  <br/> They can be active against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria  though more of them are active against gram positive bacteria.  <br/>  <br/> Some oils are active against all of the above  which is fairly unheard of in synthetic drugs.  <br/>  <br/> How much oil did I use? <br/> For external treatment  I used a lot. I used them as needed  and my need was great.  <br/>  <br/> I think it is important for people to take into account the other drugs they are taking when they start using the oils and start slower than I did to see how they tolerate them.  <br/>  <br/> Basically I would use them to the point of feeling a hint of nausea  and then I would cut back a bit from there.  <br/>  <br/> Once I got acclimated to the oils I would basically coat myself in them(diluted) from head to toe  avoiding eyes and mucous membranes.  <br/>  <br/> I would usually do this at night before I went to sleep. In the morning I would take a hot bath with essential oils.  <br/>  <br/> And when I was really sick  I would also use a far infrared heat lamp on different body parts that were having problems that day  except for on my head.  <br/>  <br/> Needless to say  between the use of essential oils and heat  I herxed a lot. As I got better  I only used the essential oils externally on different trouble spots.  <br/>  <br/> Sometimes I would have to reapply the oils consistently for a day or two or more before a specific severe symptom would subside.  <br/>  <br/> I could tell when I may be heading into a neurolyme flare because I would get severe headsplitting headaches beforehand.  <br/>  <br/> The moment I felt any tightness and tenderness in my head I would apply the essential oils  and prevented flareups that way.  <br/>  <br/> Sometimes my husband would apply them when I was already getting a little berserk  because I hadn't taken preventive action  and I would immediately feel better  calm down  and get more grounded in reality  and the head pain would subside.  <br/>  <br/> Then as I got to the point when I was feeling well most of the time and wanted to wean off the antibiotics  I started taking the oils internally along with externally as needed.  <br/>  <br/> I would take about 3-5 drops of 15% diluted essential oils 1-3 times a day. It is important to know the safety profiles of the oils before trying this.  <br/>  <br/> I would keep the oils in my mouth so that they would be absorbed through the soft palate on the roof of the mouth  under the tongue  and the inside of my cheeks.  <br/>  <br/> I would keep them in my mouth for about a minute.  Then I would usually swallow the rest  but sometimes I would spit it out after that.  <br/>  <br/> I think swallowing it improved the effects somewhat  but I think a lot of the absorption happens in the mouth. It was important for me to eat food right before or after ingestion to avoid heartburn.   <br/>  <br/> It has been about two years since I quit taking antibiotics  and I haven't had to return to them.  <br/>  <br/> I rarely use the essential oils now  and use a handful of supplements. I will occasionally use the essential oils and heat treatments  mostly before my period to keep the illness at bay as a preventive measure. <br/>  <br/> Another option for internal use is the use of hydrosols. They are milder and gentler in nature than essential oils. I used Bay Laurel Hydrosol for lymph node inflammation with good results. Another hydrosol  Greenland Moss  is also supposed to be really good for lymphatic congestion  and to get the circulation moving.  <br/>  <br/> Farah,84,12,0.070422535,Training,Training

4486.628411,yes,no,1709,96263,11,0,1,0,For those of you out there who are faced with making decisions about health insurance  here is a useful link: <br/>  http://www.healthinsurancefinders.com/healthinsurance/connecticut/  <br/>  <br/> The link directs one to the Connecticut site because I am in the town of East Lyme  yet it also provides information for other states. <br/>  <br/> My son  who is nearing 19 years old  has been infected three times with Lyme Disease. The first two times  there was at least an 11 month period before diagnosis. The most recent infection was in July of this year and was caught immediately because he found the tick on his body. I had to research health insurance because I have been out of work now for an extended period of time and he has been covered through the state insurance program for children. I have just accepted a job offer and will be starting work in early January  yet the premiums are very expensive and the provider is not widely accepted in this area. <br/>  <br/> Since my son was diagnosed and treated for Lyme within the past six months  this would be considered a pre-existing condition under an individual plan. That is of great concern to me  because he appears to have Lyme arthritis and we have an appointment with an ortho dr next week. Scary stuff indeed  because I know how expensive treatment can be. I pegged the second bout of Lyme disease once he mentioned certain complaints and I requested a Western Blot test which came back positive. Treatment ended up costing over $11K (2 courses of oral antibiotics  1 course of IV antibiotics and a PICC line infection). <br/>  <br/> I hope that people find this web link useful.

4495.015407,yes,no,818,56254,27,7,0,0,Tmmort  I suggest doing a search on here for Lunesta.  I seem to recall reading awhile back that Lunesta has caused depression for some people (but not sure if it was on here). <br/>  <br/> There is a lot of discussion on here about sleep meds  so a Lunesta search should give you some helpful info even if it doesn't directly answer your question. <br/>  <br/> I do know from personal experience that most sleep meds linger in the body longer than the 8-9 hours of sleep. So even if you feel well-rested  the Lunesta could be lingering well into the following day and causing you to feel  down . <br/>  <br/> I recommend trying a few nights without the Lunesta to see if the depression lifts. Your increased Doxepin dose combined with the Lunesta could also be resulting in some unpleasant psychological side effects?,13,19,0.04137931,Training,Training

Following the second series  I was quite well  except for some fatigue  for many months. <br/>  <br/> I have since used LYM in a vial in conjunction with biophotonic therapy with lightworks with good success. <br/>  <br/> I have had two lyme recurrances since I was pronounced  lyme free.   I got symptoms again once after a big road trip  and once after my father's sudden death. <br/>  <br/> Both times I used LYM and light therapy  along with Venex bee venom ointment  and PRL products Biotox Elim and SpiroNil.  Lyme stopped testing positive again by muscle testing in about two weeks. <br/>  <br/> I'm not as well at the moment as I would like to be  esp due to stress from the recent tragedy and issues surrounding it.  I am currently treating two systemic fungals and antibiotic resistant strep pneumonia with nosodes not found in the DB products.  Good progress there as well. <br/>  <br/> Dousing/muscle testing of DB products shows that Mycoplasma is my next treatment priority  along with Nerve Z  a detox and HSV homeopathic.  I will use the DB Mycoplasma nosode probably as the homochord  and nerve Z in a vials with biophotonics (Lightworks) once I have cleared the current treatments. <br/>  <br/> I am very comfortable suggesting that people look into using these products as good therapeutic treatments for lyme disease  especially with the help of a good naturopath or homeopathic practitioner.

It has been the treatment we have used the most. <br/>  <br/> We now use it through a EMX EMEM so there is nothing to hold onto.  It also seems to penetrate places using it this way that it did not using the contact method. <br/>  <br/> The big advantage with the GB-4000 is the ability to gate the frequencies and the ability to run eight frequencies at a time.  This saves a lot of time.  We can run all of the CAFL Lyme frequencies in a little over an hour.  This shotgun approach eliminates the need to find the effective frequencies.  You simply run them all. <br/>  <br/> It also can run autoprograms and sweep the autoprograms also.  The extra features are really all you are buying. <br/>  <br/> If money is no object and the features are something you want then go for it.  I do not believe it is any more effective than what you already have.  But the ability to run many more frequencies in a shorter time may mean shorter treatment times. <br/>  <br/> Your Doug Coil should penetrate better than most any other frequency device. <br/>  <br/> I think there was a used GB-4000 and amp for sale on the Yahoo Lyme Rife group for $1 200.00 <br/> I am not sure if it is still available  but that is an excellent price. <br/>  <br/> D Bergy,8,13,0.063670412,Training,Training

4557.328349,no,no,6352,62829,161,7,2,0,posted in Dr. Singleton's newsletter from  www.lymedoctor.com  <br/>  <br/> More on the Miracle of Vitamin D - Part Two (of Three)  <br/> Last month we began a discussion of vitamin D. As you may recall from my article and my book  The Lyme Disease Solution  I am a major supporter of blood testing for vitamin D levels and of treating vitamin D deficiency aggressively using  vitamin D3 . As I expected  I received several responses from readers challenging the notion that vitamin D was  in fact  beneficial in the chronic Lyme disease setting. Therefore  in this article I wish to first of all deal with the idea that vitamin D is harmful to Lyme patients. <br/>  <br/> Several years ago I became aware of something that many of you know called the  Marshall Protocol  (MP). Originally developed to help patients with sarcoidosis by Trevor Marshall  Ph.D.  his theories led him to recommend his protocol for the treatment of patients with other chronic inflammatory conditions such as chronic fatigue  fibromyalgia  and chronic Lyme.  <br/>  <br/> Basically  the protocol consists of 3 components: (1) low dose antibiotics (primarily minocycline)  (2) use of an oral antihypertensive (in the ARB class) called Benicar  and (3) severe restriction of vitamin D both via dietary restriction and reduction of sunlight exposure. This protocol got my attention primarily because it was being recommended by an LLMD whom I respect  Dietrich Klinghardt  M.D.  Ph.D. (Interestingly  Dr. Klinghardt has subsequently stated on a DVD in 2006 that his MP results had been disappointing.) <br/>  <br/> A thorough review of the MP is much too large a subject to attempt to tackle in this Newsletter. In short  I do not believe that the preponderance of evidence shows that vitamin D (in either the 25-OH or 1 25-OH form) clinically acts as an immunosuppressive steroid  as alleged by the MP. Rather  I see vitamin D as being a very important immune-modulating substance that ramps up  Th1  when needed and cools down  Th1  when not needed. I refer you a very scholarly webpage that discusses the controversy related to the MP in great depth. Please see the following excellent site that covers the topic very well:  http://stuff.mit.edu/people/london/universe.htm  <br/>  <br/> Meanwhile  if your LLMD is using the MP and you are doing well  I do not recommend that you make any major changes based on this Newsletter alone. However  if you are improving  the truth is that it could very well be due to the low dose antibiotics being used on the MP. I doubt vitamin D deprivation has much to do with any benefit you are gaining. My experience would say that there is not nearly enough evidence to justify restriction of such an important thing as vitamin D. <br/>  <br/> The next topic I wish to cover transitions nicely from the previous discussion. Did you know that vitamin D has important antibiotic properties? The story of tuberculosis (TB) illustrates this well. Before the advent of antibiotics against TB in the 1950's and 1960's  the treatment for TB was a three step program: get several months of rest (for instance at a  sanitorium )  drink one quart of milk daily  and get several hours of sunlight exposure daily. It turns out that this treatment protocol helped many people recover from TB. The secret to its success was  in great part  due to the effect of sunlight in increasing levels of vitamin D in the body. Vitamin D was instrumental not only in improving immune function  but also in the production of a substance called  cathelicidin . Cathelicidin is produced by the white blood cells and is active against viruses (ex. influenza and cold viruses)  tuberculosis  and fungi.  <br/>  <br/> Could it also have effects against Lyme bacteria? If so  is this why Lyme patients generally feel much better in the summer when sunlight exposure raises vitamin D (and cathelicidin) levels in the body? No one knows for sure  but I suspect that trio of sunlight  vitamin D  and cathelicidin is very helpful for both its immune supporting properties and its possible antibiotic effects against Lyme. <br/>  <br/> What about testing for vitamin D? The consensus among experts is that the best blood test to do is the  25-OH vitamin D  level. It is the form of vitamin D that is made by the liver and is a true indicator of the vitamin D status of the body. It is then activated by the kidneys and at the local tissue level to the active form called  1 25-OH vitamin D . While the MP recommends testing 25-OH and 1 25-OH  I would disagree with the need to test 1 25-OH. And I recommend reading the above mentioned webpage in order to understand all the reasons for omitting the test for 1 25-OH. <br/>  <br/> Are all labs able to do accurate vitamin D testing? The major commercial labs are Labcorp and Quest. Both do vitamin D 25-OH levels. However  there is a fundamental difference in the methodology used by each lab. Quest uses the LC-MS/MS (liquid chromotatography-mass spectrometry) method. Labcorp uses the more reliable Liaison (DiaSorin) method. My understanding is that the Labcorp methodology is the preferred method and  therefore  this is the lab you should request for having your vitamin D assay done if at all possible. <br/>  <br/> What are the normal and optimal levels for 25-OH vitamin D? You will find vitamin D levels measured using 2 different types of units: (1) ng/ml and (2) nmol/l. The most common way of reporting vitamin D levels is in the  ng/ml  format (used by the commercial labs) and that is the one we will use in the Newsletter. Here is what we consider to be  normal  and  optimal  levels of vitamin D. <br/>  <br/> Normal levels: 20-56 ng/ml <br/> Optimal levels: 45-65 ng/ml (and should never fall below 30 ng/ml) <br/>  <br/> How often should a vitamin D level be checked? In general  I recommend checking vitamin D 25-OH levels two to three times a year - in the fall  the mid winter  and perhaps sometime in the summer (to see if supplementation is necessary when sun exposure is at its greatest). <br/>  <br/> Next month I will discuss in the Newsletter the best ways to achieve an optimal level of vitamin D. We'll look at sunlight exposure and sunscreens. We'll look oral supplementation - vitamin D2 vs. D3. We'll answer the question of how much to take in order to predictably raise your levels.

Ask for combo therapy!  It cant hurt to try for a month or two. <br/>  <br/> Recently  I said the same thing to my doctor  because she felt I didnt show any signs of coinfections  did not test positive for any (3 times)  and didnt need to be overloaded with abx. <br/>  <br/> I feel like my last few symptoms could be bart related. I get really bad soreness in my neck alot  which is my biggest complaint right now with other symptoms such as heel foot pain on/off  vision difficulties  and sore lymph nodes under my arms which are all on/off. <br/>  <br/> So I insisted that I may have bart symptoms and she then put me this month on rifampin and TOA Prima Una de Gato. (cats claw) <br/>  <br/> She also said my immune system has to improve because without that your body cant fight off the lyme by itself. <br/>  <br/> You may not be improving because of alot of other factors besides the lyme or co's like viruses  metals  mold  parasites  immune system not being boosted  biofilms or things of this nature.  <br/>  <br/> Lots of threads have been posted here about abx not working or treatment results which have plateaued. <br/>  <br/> I have been on monotherapy for 7 months and I have almost recovered to 90-95%. <br/>  <br/> May I suggest you list of ALL your symptoms and discuss with your doctor and at the next visit say   lets compare where I was in the beginning to now.  It also helps LLMD's to determine what symptoms could be co related. <br/>  <br/> I did this and it seemed to help sway her decision to try the combo therapy. Some doctors may be fearful of being sued. <br/>  <br/> So far I have been on doxy  biaxin  zithro  and now rifampin with cat's claw. <br/>  <br/> I am also petrified that if I end therapy in a few months I will relapse because I havent been treating with combo therapy. <br/>  <br/> Most doctors recommend combo  but if the therapy is working and you truly feel better since the beginning  than thats whats important. <br/>  <br/> Monotherapy does leave me with doubts about it being thorough  even though I feel I am in the home stretch.,14,13,0.068965517,Training,Training

4626.446336,no,no,1546,95795,2,0,1,0,I have been poking around this site as I think I might have Lyme disease and wanted to point out some info for those with Lyme that just doesnt go away.   <br/>  <br/> I don't know if anyone is familiar with the research of Dr. Ritchie Soemaker but he has done amazing work with biotoxin associated illnesses  of which Lyme is one.  <br/>  <br/> So the borrelia bacteria produces biotoxins in the human body which elicit a cascade of inflamatory responses and send multiple biofeedback systems out of whack.  About 25% percent of the population has one of the few specific genetic profiles that prevent their immune systems from recognizing this biotoxin and attacking it for elimiation. So the toxin just keeps recirculating in your body even after if the borrelia has been killed by antibiotics.  Well Shoemaker discovered that the biotoxin can be elimiated with Cholestyramine which was orginally produced as a way to bind free cholesterol.  But I guess it molecular structure just happens to perfectly interact the biotoxins as well.  It's taken as a powder and has minimal side effects.  <br/>  <br/> For more info:  www.biotoxin.info    <br/> This is Shoemaker's site and he has also written several easy to read and very informative books.   <br/>  <br/> He has a practice in Maryland which I hope to go to to get my own illness figured out  whether it be from Lyme or molds which also produce biotoxins.   <br/>  <br/> I apologize if this info is redundant.  <br/>  <br/> My heart goes out to all of you.  Hang in there. <br/>  <br/> Jenn,2,15,0.056818182,Training,Training

Not only is it one of the hardest thing to digest  it is also a trigger for migraine headaches. <br/>  <br/> I know breakfast can be awfully hard when following this diet. That's where I think including a little whole grain brown rice (if you can tolerate it) really comes in handy. <br/>  <br/> Brown rice hot cereal (just like oatmeal or cream of wheat) is easy to digest. It's much easier to digest than crunchy or puffed things like rice cakes or cereal. It is also sugar free! <br/>  <br/> Bob Redmill has a fantastic one- Brown Rice Farina hot cereal. If you make it with almond milk  it's delicious. It's very creamy. It also makes for a good snack! <br/>  <br/> 4 Season's idea of a smoothie was great too.  <br/>  <br/> Keebler is also right about juicing. It's one of the best things you can do for your body. I personally love anything with carrot juice (though I have to be careful with it. It's a little sweet so some people can't do it at all. I find that if I'm in a phase where I can't do it  I replace it with celery juice). Carrots  Celery  Cucumber and Broccoli is a yummy combination. They have lots of books out there on juicing that have recipe suggestions.,17,19,0.044247788,Training,Training

4722.469382,yes,no,3249,69986,742,58,1,0,It's time to post my success story: <br/>  <br/> I'm finally well from lyme for the past three months  and well into recovery from the effects of lyme. <br/>  <br/> My recovery took nine months.  They were some of the hardest months of my whole illness because I forced myself to stay in heavy herx mode most of that time.    <br/>  <br/> I am still continuing to get well after three months without symptoms  and a very high stress load because my daughter was hospitalized for an accident. <br/>  <br/> I had borrelia  bartonella  babesia  and klebsiella pneumonia. <br/>  <br/> I have had tick born infections since I was about seven years old.  I have to wonder if the case of  mumps with encephalitis  I had when I was seven was really from a tick bite.   <br/>  <br/> My next door neighbor had bartonella when I was little.  I started having bladder spasms and difficulty communicating verbally  and memory loss at that time. <br/>  <br/> The big bite happened when I was 22 (Over 20 years ago.)  Two weeks after pulling off several ticks I started having mysterious bladder symptoms  chronic pain  and fatigue.  They got worse and worse over the years.   <br/>  <br/> I fought them off with diet  supplements and exercise.  Symptoms rose and fell over the years with my stress level  causing them to be labeled as psychosomatic. <br/>  <br/> Both pregnancies were nightmare with being unable to sleep  get up  eat  think  etc.  My second breast fed child reacted to my high cortisol levels by never sleeping  which kept the levels high until my adrenals crashed entirely.  Then lyme took over and I was completely unable to function.   <br/>  <br/> My naturopath put me on Cortef  which gave me enough ability back to pursue more answers.  Then he got me a positive lyme test which put me on the road to recovery.  For this I will be eternally grateful. <br/>  <br/> One year later  I have my life back.  I think I will be able to get my health back to the point where I will feel energetic again. I'm still fighting off some candida  and may want to test for H. Pylori. I'm still stiff  but no more pain.   I'd like to drop the spare 15 pounds  but I think that will take care of itself as I continue to heal.  <br/>  <br/> I can think.  What's more  I can feel.  I am happy.  I can experience something other than anguish  misery  dread  terror.   <br/>  <br/> Life is good.  I am playing with my kids  going skiing  running  socializing  working  etc.  My house is clean  and my affairs are mostly in order. I'm even homeschooling my middle schooler  and loving it.   <br/>  <br/> My protocol was based on a combination of ILADS  Buhner  and Dr. K. in WA.  I am under-insured  have no area LLMD  and was unable to travel.  I read two to three hours a day  and put it together myself  with the help of some local practitioners.  <br/>  <br/> If you want to read my regimen and protocol here is the link to the post. <br/>  http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=062900#000000  <br/>  <br/> I wish you all the very best in health and in lifelong wellness and vitality.

Approximately 20% of patients have a history of a preceding erythema migrans lesion  usually of the same extremity [242]. Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is diagnosed most frequently in women greater than 40 years of age.  Although any of the species of Lyme Borrelia may cause the lesion   by far the most common etiologic agent is B. afzelii. Therefore  this manifestation is much more common in Europe than in the United States [243?246]. <br/>  <br/> Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans occurs most often on the extensor surfaces of the hands and feet  and early lesions are characterized by a slight bluish-red discoloration and doughy swelling. Initially unilateral  the lesion may later become bilateral. The lesion enlarges slowly over months to years  in association with resolution of the edema and development of skin atrophy (figure 4)  (sometimes referred to as ?cigarette paper skin?) . Nodules may develop over bony prominences  such as the elbow or patella [197  242  247]. In some patients  sclerosing lesions develop. Because of atrophy of the skin  the veins become prominent  which may lead to a misdiagnosis of venous insufficiency [109  197  242]. Approximately two-thirds of patients have an associated peripheral neuropathy  typically involving the affected extremity  manifested primarily as local sensory loss [248  249]. <br/>  <br/> The diagnosis of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is based on appropriate epidemiology  clinical characteristics  histological findings  and IgG seropositivity. Histopathology shows a pronounced lymphoplasmacellular infiltration of the skin and sometimes also of the subcutis  with or without atrophy [195]. <br/>  <br/>  Evidence to support treatment recommendations.  <br/>  <br/> Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans does not appear to resolve spontaneously. There are no prospective  randomized studies on treatment. Oral or parenteral antimicrobial therapy (table 2) given for 3 weeks (range  2?4 weeks) has resulted in improvement in pain and swelling  diminution in fibrous nodules  and gradual fading of the lesion within 2?6 months [250?252]. <br/>  <br/> Atrophic areas often persist  and little objective improvement can be demonstrated in the neuropathy in uncontrolled studies  regardless of whether antibiotics are administered parenterally. However  progression of neurologic involvement is halted  and the neuropathic symptoms of pain and paresthesia are improved [251  252].  In the United States  treatment of Lyme disease?associated peripheral neuropathy with intravenous ceftriaxone usually results in improvement . The reasons for the differences in the experience with this manifestation of the disease in the United States and Europe are not clear. <br/>  <br/>  Recommendations  <br/>  <br/> 1. Available data indicate that acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans may be treated with a 21-day course of the same antibiotics (doxycycline [B-II]  amoxicillin [B-II]  or cefuroxime axetil [B-III]) used to treat patients with erythema migrans (tables 2 and 3). A controlled study is warranted to compare oral with parenteral antibiotic therapy for the treatment of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. <br/>  <br/> Page 25 <br/>  http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/508667 ,105,22,0.040776699,Training,Training

It was Lee Jones? first time turkey hunting  and all he came back with that day was a tick that was clinging to his inner thigh.  <br/>  <br/> Rather  the tick caught him. <br/>  <br/> That was April 22  the last day of turkey season. A week later  a rash appeared where he was bitten.  <br/>  <br/> Doctors knew it was a tick-borne illness  but they were unprepared for what it turned out to be ? Rocky Mountain spotted fever.  <br/>  <br/>  We never dreamed it (RMSF) was in this area   said his wife  Susie.  <br/>  <br/> RMSF is the most severe and most frequently reported rickettsial illness in the U.S.  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. <br/>  <br/> The disease can be difficult to diagnose in the early stages and  without prompt and appropriate treatment  it can be fatal.  <br/>  <br/> Lee was treated for Lyme disease  and although it?s possible he had that  too  the antibiotic  Amoxicillin  used wasn?t enough to kill off the RMSF that was in his system.  <br/>  <br/> Lee was bitten by the tick  a Lonestar type  while hunting on Eglin reservation near Niceville  where he usually hunts for deer.  <br/>  <br/> The Niceville man has been hunting since he was 12 years old and is accustomed to checking himself for ticks after finishing a day in the field. <br/>  <br/> This was the first problem he?s ever had  and it almost cost him his life.  <br/>  <br/> The last several months have been rough on him  with Lee even having to miss three weeks of work. He suffers from headaches  constant fatigue and  occasionally  severe fevers that are difficult to break.  <br/>  <br/>  The hardest thing is trying to get up in the morning   said Lee  who has always been active.  <br/>  <br/> He is now on Doxycycline  which is said to knock out the disease while in the early stages. But even after taking a round of antibiotics  he was told last Tuesday that the disease is still in his system.  <br/>  <br/>  We don?t know what his future holds.

I am keping a very close eye on all of these areas as I get bloods taken every 2 weeks.  4 weeks in and my bloods are better than ever.  All liver and kidney function perfectly in the centre of normal ranges. <br/>  <br/> I have been doing 3 grams 4 times daily with 3 grams of vit C.  This could very well be a herx.  Time will tell hopefully.  I have had a full on worsening of all symptoms in this flare.  We all have problems knowing what is a herx and what is a worsening in condition I suppose.,18,21,0.036363636,Training,Training
4864.261011,yes,no,1006,131066,56,2,0,0,Yes  I've had problems w/ getting covered since graduating from law school. However  I was able to get my PPO group plan that I had with the university converted to an individual plan  by invoking one of the state HIPPA (HIPAA?) laws in CA. The premiums and deductibles are super high but at least it's coverage. I'm sure there are similar  conversion  statutes in CT.  <br/>  <br/> Also  perhaps there is a way to deem you a  <br/>  dependent  for insurance purposes  even after you graduate and are technically no longer part of your parent's household  so you can still stay on your parents plan. I know I've heard of people doing this when they reach the age of majority but cannot work due to disability or illness. <br/>  <br/> And worst case scenario  you could resort to various federal disability and need-based programs... <br/>  <br/> And hopefully  by the time you'll actually have to worry about this we'll have a new Prez with a new policy for covering the uninsured  one that actually works.,5,21,0.04,Training,Training

4872.793912,yes,no,1630,27643,110,1,0,0,I never saw my original rash  but when I was on the the Cowden Protocol and herxing like crazy  I found out why I had not seen it. <br/>  <br/> I was checking out a GYN problem one day to see if it had  gotten any worse  when I found a classic EM rash on the upper back of my left thigh  almost in the groin  right where you'd expect it if you were wearing shorts and sat on a log to rest while out hiking.   <br/>  <br/> I was very outdoorsy before this sh*t hit me. Because it did not hurt or itch and because of where it was located  I never would have noticed this rash at all  if I had not checked the GYN problem  which thankfully was not changed. <br/>  <br/> Over the next month  the ring cleared in the center and expanded  then started fading  only to be replaced by another EM right next to it. This process repeated itself twice  for a total of 3 EM rashes. <br/>  <br/> I don't have an LLMD  but I went to my PCP. She is not Lyme-literate  but the first thing she said when she saw my rash was  that looks like a tick rash . This occured when I arrived at the highest dose of Samento I was able to tolerate. <br/>  <br/> So  yes  I think it could be the Cowden Protocol chasing the little buggers out through your skin.  <br/>  <br/> However  if I were you  I'd not take that chance. Since you are lucky enough to be able to take ABX (I am allergic to all of them)  I would go for another round of the early stage ABX protocol ASAP  just in case this is a new reinfection.  <br/>  <br/> After all  the nymphal ticks are the size of a grain of pepper  so you might have missed one. <br/>  <br/> Good luck  <br/> klutzo,6,17,0.052631579,Training,Training

I have heard that minocycline has other effects besides antibiotic that help people with ALS and or MS. I cant imagine such a small does would knock out active Bb symptoms.. ?? <br/>  <br/> Or  I am just getting coincidental  break  in symptoms.:-) <br/>  <br/> I would love to be able to sort out some sense in these symptoms and get comfortable with the energetic testing. I was doing pretty well for a while with it. <br/>  <br/> Keeping in mind the possible sequence: <br/>  <br/> Die off from pathogens  followed by release of metals (probably from biofilm)and candida (not sure how it relates except know there is a symbiotic relationship with the Bb and yeast and/or the mercury and yeast) <br/>  <br/> Die off from parasites  followed by Bb and pathogen flares (metals and candida too?) <br/>  <br/> Chelation of mecury  followed by release of Bb. You pull the mercury out of biofilm  that releases the Bb..  <br/>  <br/> The ammonia is either from die off from Bb  I think candida or from a faulty methylation-detox thing.. see I dont understand that yet. I think Yasko does call it or something NH3.  <br/>  <br/> We don't know yet since tests are pending or sitting here for me to complete at home. Zyto is picking up ammonia. I have a feeling the ammonia is what has caused my hypersomnia as it has been associated with African Sleeping Sickness. I feel like a thick fluid is passing over my brain when I feel like I cant stay awake. <br/>  <br/> I've been afraid to do the nogiers.

The effects of the light last longer  so the actual  killing  could still be taking place while the metals start releasing?  <br/>  <br/> Less of a line between the actions in the body?,1051,14,0.064356436,Experimental,Experimental

I also still had symptoms while I was pregnant. <br/>  <br/> My son is now 4  he is diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome  attention problems  sensory processing disorder  impulsiveness  mood swings  anger problems and has sensitivity to lights and sounds. <br/> Extremely smart  verbal skills above normal. <br/> Had acid reflux as an infant and colic. <br/>  <br/> I always had in the back of mind  could he have lyme? I tested him through Questrecently  which i know stinks  he was neg. Did test positive for band 41 and 66. <br/>  <br/> I am now testing him through Igenex  where i was diagnosed several years ago. <br/>  <br/> Anyone have any insight into my story? I know this could all be related to his disorder  but i cant help wonder. <br/> Thanks  this has been eating me up. <br/> Tracey,13,10,0.079096045,Experimental,Experimental

Is it ok to take artemisin together with rifampin? <br/> Or are there interactions due to liver pathway. <br/> And furthermore is artemisin together with azithromycin + rifampin and pulsed tinidazole enough to not create resistance of babesia?  <br/> I suspect babs. because of air hunger  diarrhea night sweats huge die off with clindamycin a couple of month ago and then feeling better. Also tinidazole/metronidazole helps me. <br/>  <br/> What is the best combination for bart and babs at the same time.? Or do I have to treat bart first? <br/>  <br/> Anyone tried this? <br/>  <br/> Best  <br/> Stefan <br/>  <br/> ___________________________________________________________  <br/> Male 36 years (Germany) CFIDS  IBS  Enterovirus  Cpn and Bartonella positive.

I live in a highly endemic area (ma) where this is everywhere.  <br/>  <br/> Starting with getting sick in 2001 until currently I have had 95% of symptoms on the Lyme list.  <br/>  <br/> Fast forward have seen a LLMD Nuero who was very comprehensive ct  mri  ekg  nerve conduction study  spect  spinal tap  cognitive test plus in office exams all came back negative. After 3 months of Doxy my cognitive test went up from 90 to 129. CD57 is a 60 and b12 was low at this time  <br/>  <br/> I question her multiple times specifically about Parkinson?s because constant shaking/tremor in hands and being rigid but she says no she thinks Lyme I causing my problems. Refers me to another LLMD who can treat me long term.  <br/>  <br/> Currently for the last 5 weeks am on all oral 1000mg of Biaxin 2x day  bactrim 2x a day flagyl 2x a day and some yeast medicine taken orally. Also on a prescription b vitamin as my B2 and B6 are extremely low. <br/>  <br/> Not sure what to do from here I?m having extremely extradited symptoms as of the last week and my anxiety is through the rough.  I cannot stop looking on the web and diagnosing my self with Parkinson?s as some of the symptoms match up. Can anybody help me with information or similar situations? Was I too late in catching this or is there still hope I can make some recovery? Could this be Lyme only?,13,20,0.043165468,Experimental,Experimental

151.5393371,yes,yes,2171,64565,5,0,0,0,Dont wanna drag this post out too long    heres my story... One morning woke up extremely disconnected  foggy feeling.  Prior to this  which led to my clinical diagnosis  i wsa mountain bikeing in a notoriously tick infested park here in central NJ. 20+ doctors  just got the its all in your head approach.  Finally researched lyme  got an igenex testing kit  ending up have positive on the IGG one  the one that stands for a long lasting infection.  Treated PICC Line rocephin 4 months  no real improvement..  <br/> Forgot to mention very vague symptoms  treated mostly on clinical diagnosis. symptoms.. Disconnected  foggy  derealization like symptoms  vision issues including light sensitive  hazy vision and floaters... mild fatigue... ABSOLUTLEY no phyiscal pain  no joint pain no headaches.   Had spinal tap negative  brain SPECT was positive (although im told by other drs. that a healthy brain could look abnormal on that testing as its so sensitive) all blood tests done by stony brook just one band.   switched drs to a more aggressive approach and a more well known dr  tryed ton of orals  heavy dose of rocephin for 5 more months  all different oral combos including zithromax  doryx  mino  biaxin  ceftin.  Felt better then i do now when i was treating but still not what i should have dr felt.  She began to doubt the lyme diagnosis.  And then outta the blue  i get a positive which she seemed to be so terrific as my body starting to produce antibodies. But now im still doubting diagnosis as i never really herxed  nor improved greatly.  Im starting to think maybe a coinfection could be to blame but like i said my symptoms are all neuro  and  have been tested for them millions of times it seems.  Just lookin for some advice on how to take this positive test  could it be a false positive?? could it be a coinfection as i never had ANY physical pain and never really progressed  heard bart is mainly neuro.  very confused and considering goin back on IV but sooo expenseive..   im 25 yrs old.. go to gym 5 day a week  really pretty healthy  but vision has gotten so much worse  and brain fog... noone has given me any answers except my LLMD.  thank you,5,188,0.00265252,Experimental,Experimental
152.2705898,yes,yes,3552,18429,4,0,0,0,Hi  <br/>       <br/>  <br/> Just a bit of background which might help gauge my lyme risk. I've been ill with 'M.E' for almost 22 years  from the age of 17  for the last 15 pretty seriously  especially with immune system symptoms - constant infections/ viruses and allergies etc.  <br/> Upto being ill I worked as a veterinary nurse and also was type of child/ person who was outside alot  playing in woods  fields  going for walks in them too etc  and also had a bit of a 'penchant' for nursing sick wild animals back to health - birds  squirrels  hedgehogs etc  and if there was any animal near me  I'd be there!!! Also some of these areas I used to walk/ picnic etc in are deer forests. We also have muntjac deer in woods over the road and as a child I was always playing in those woods and fields. Stayed on farms etc too. <br/> I also rode horses when I was younger.  <br/> Previously tested positive for EBV - but not HHPV6  CMV  or Chlamydia. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Telling you all this as thus far I've had 4 different tests for lyme  and it seems for me there seems a less than convincing answer to whether I am positive or negative to it  so wonder what people on here's opinion would be. I have a LLMD here in England  but I also want to form my own opiion before they give me theirs - I think theirs will be 'yes' tho. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> My test results are as follows; <br/>  <br/> Test 1. LTT-MELISA - Laborzentrum Bremen <br/>  <br/> Negative .....  <br/> ... but the lab suggested a retest by a different method as my immune system was acting so oddly - a high background inflammatory response  the result couldn't be relied on. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Test 2. IGENEX WESTERN BLOT <br/>  <br/> IgM: Negative - CDC + Igenex <br/>  <br/> The following bands were marked though; <br/>  <br/> 39 kDa + <br/> 41 kDa IND <br/> 83-93 kDa IND <br/>  <br/> IGG: Negative - CDC + Igenex <br/> The following band was marked though; <br/>  <br/> 41 kDa IND <br/>  <br/>  <br/> LYME IgG/ IgM SEROLOGY: 0.26 - negative if &lt; 1.0 <br/>  <br/> BABESIA MICROTI ANTIBODY: <br/> IgG &lt;1:40 Negative  <br/> IgM &lt;1:20 Negative <br/>  <br/> HUMAN EHRICHIA MONOCYTIC - HME PANEL:  <br/> IgM 1:20 - may suggest disease progression and/ or treatment  <br/> IgG &lt; 1:40 Negative <br/>  <br/> HUMAN EHRICHIA GRANULOCYTIC - HGE PANEL:  <br/> IgM &lt;1:20 Negative  <br/> IgG &lt;1:40 Negative <br/>  <br/> BARTONELLA HENSELAE ANTIBODY:  <br/> IgM &lt;1:20 Negative  <br/> IgG &lt;1:40 Negative <br/>  <br/>  <br/> TEST 3.

Any thoughts GREATLY appreciated! I don't want to put my body or bank balance through costly treatments needlessly  but there again I'm desperate to get better and feel I do have a chronic infection that needs addressing  whatever that is. <br/>  <br/> Kind regards  and thanks in advance     ,7,6,0.134646962,Experimental,Experimental

I go tomorrow to get blood drawn for more tests. <br/>  <br/> I've had doc after doc tell me no  I don't have Lyme  and I'm sure lots here understand that I'm feeling unsure as I begin seeking treatment.

This occurred 3 days after hiking in the forest. It is about 2 inches in diameter and is fading today-day 4. I took her to her pediatrician  he assured me that lyme disease takes 3 weeks to develop into a rash  and not to worry since there was no tick observed. He said it was merely a histamine reaction. She has other bites  none which formed this pink ring. <br/>  I have read the CDC site's statement that the rash appears in 3 to 30 days  so now I am concerned.  <br/> Should I be worried?

243.0456561,yes,yes,1576,22762,1072,4,0,0,Keebler has given you some good info and advice. <br/>  <br/> When I first started to take steps to detox I made myself very sick. At the time  I was following my doctors instructions. I had no idea one could get that sick from detoxifying.  I was on the couch for a week and prior to that I was in pretty good shape. Like you  I was really shocked at how sick it made me feel.   <br/>  <br/> That was decades before I knew I had undiagnosed lyme and all these other infections coupled with detox issues.  Didn't know much then about detoxification but that really woke me up and I started researching detoxification methods. <br/>  <br/> Glutathione is a strong detoxifier.  It can cause reactions.  Also  as Keeb said  sulfur could be an issue.  Both glutathione and NAC are sulfur bearing supplements. <br/>  <br/> I would suggest starting with one detox step at a time.  The sauna alone or NAC alone or glutathione alone.  As you tolerate one  add another in if you feel it is appropriate for your specific goals.   <br/>  <br/> I'd start slower with the sauna - less time.  Is this a FIR sauna?  Are you showering immediately after?  Are you replacing electrolytes and fluids after the sauna? <br/>  <br/> 2 caps of charcoal isn't very much if they are the normal caps of around 560 mg.  You may want to do some research and increase the dose.  Be sure to take it far away from other supplements  meds  food. <br/>  <br/> Exactly what are your goals with detox?  Are you working on biotoxins or just trying to provide general support for your liver or? <br/>  <br/> Terry,22,15,0.056737589,Experimental,Experimental

I was feeling better during antibiotics  and even after stop antibiotics (symptoms still there but a lot less severe).  Yesterday  i start on Amox again (500mg  3 times/day) and today when i woke up  i feel worse again  start feeling pain in legs  neck  under armpits  needle and pins  burning  tingling  sore throat.  Is this herxing becuase of i'm back on antibiotics?  I don't know what's herxing and how it feel and when it'll come  please help. <br/>  <br/> Thanks.,6,21,0.03539823,Experimental,Experimental

299.2500562,no,yes,2975,25894,97,8,0,0,This article was emailed to me  wonder if this is a factor? <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Immune exhaustion driven by antigen in chronic viral infection: <br/>  <br/> A main reason why viruses such as HIV or hepatitis C persist despite a vigorous initial immune response is exhaustion. The T cells  or white blood cells  fighting a chronic infection eventually wear out. <br/>  <br/> Researchers at Emory Vaccine Center have demonstrated that exhaustion is driven by how the immune system detects infecting viruses. <br/>  <br/> To recognize the presence of a viral infection  T cells must be presented with bits of viral protein in a molecular frame supplied by other cells in the body -- called MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class I molecules. <br/>  <br/> In mice infected by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)  T cells became more or less exhausted depending on how much properly framed viral protein was available. <br/>  <br/> Insights from the research could guide efforts to revive the immune system in people with chronic viral infections. The results are published online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. <br/>  <br/> Working with Vaccine Center director Rafi Ahmed  PhD  postdoctoral fellow Scott Mueller  PhD  examined the effects of limiting what kind of cells could display the viral antigens. <br/>  <br/> Ahmed is professor of microbiology and immunology at Emory University School of Medicine and a Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar. <br/>  <br/> By performing bone marrow transplants on genetically engineered mice  Mueller created mice with MHC class I molecules on blood and immune system cells but missing from other cells such as nerve cells and connective tissue. LCMV infects both cells that come from bone marrow and cells that don't.  <br/>  <br/> But the roles each type of cell plays in communicating the infection to the immune system is different. <br/>  <br/>  We were trying to sort out which of several factors contribute to T cell exhaustion  such as viral antigen  inflammation and where the immune system encounters the virus   Mueller says.  <br/>  <br/>  What came out of these experiments allowed us to answer a broad question: the role of antigen in driving exhaustion.  <br/>  <br/> When injected with LCMV  the altered mice had more energetic and responsive T cells early during the infection. But later  the altered mice had much higher levels of virus and more exhausted T cells. This contrast demonstrates how the level of antigen present is the motor behind immune exhaustion during the chronic infection. <br/>  <br/>  Early on  the T cells were healthier because they saw less antigen  and only saw it on cells that came from bone marrow   Mueller says.  But later  the immune system had trouble getting rid of the virus because the T cells couldn't recognize infection in cells that were not able to present the viral antigens.  <br/>  <br/> Holly Korschun <br/> Emory University,34,13,0.066945607,Experimental,Experimental

324.2743799,yes,yes,3513,44404,1,0,0,0,My ex-wife and I moved to Texas in July (we were <br/>  <br/>  still married then) from Iowa where we lived for  <br/>  <br/> 6 years and did a lot of hiking.  Her sister has  <br/>  <br/> been fighting Lyme for a few years; so I'm aware  <br/>  <br/> of the terrible struggle she has gone through.   <br/>  <br/> From November to now I've been getting over  <br/>  <br/> various medical issues.  I had gastritis   <br/>  <br/> confirmed by a endoscopy  and had an h. pylori  <br/>  <br/> infection which is gone after 12 days on a  <br/>  <br/> PrevPac (confirmed by biopsy).  So my stomach is  <br/>  <br/> doing better.  After having a cold and coughing  <br/>  <br/> in November  I developed slight pain in my  <br/>  <br/> sternum  which was diagnosed as costochondritis  <br/>  <br/> (had chest xrays  nothing else found and it  <br/>  <br/> wasn't/isn't my heart).  Also developed  at the  <br/>  <br/> same time as the chest stuff  some muscle pain in  <br/>  <br/> my middle upper back.  All that has improved   <br/>  <br/> though still lingering pain.  And my stomach is  <br/>  <br/> still sensitive.  In the middle of all that  <br/>  <br/> (middle of January)  I was taking Tramadol for  <br/>  <br/> the chest pain and  I think  took too much one  <br/>  <br/> day.  The next day I woke up having muscle spasms  <br/>  <br/> and twitches.  The spasms and twitches have all  <br/>  <br/> but gone away (saw a neurologist to be safe and  <br/>  <br/> he did various tests and found nothing).  Also  <br/>  <br/> beginning when taking the Tramadol  I was feeling  <br/>  <br/> light-headed for a few hours almost everyday.   <br/>  <br/> That went on until about 3 weeks ago. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> My ex-sister-in-law talked me into sending some  <br/>  <br/> blood to IGenex for testing.  I did the IgG and  <br/>  <br/> IgM Western Blot and whole blood and serum  <br/>  <br/> multiplex tests.  Everything came back negative  <br/>  <br/> except for the IgG  which came back with two ++  <br/>  <br/> on both bands 31 and 41  an IND on band 39  and a  <br/>  <br/> single + on both bands 58 and 66.  IGenex reads  <br/>  <br/> that as being positive for Lyme exposure whereas  <br/>  <br/> the CDC does not. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I've made an appointment with a LLMD in the DC  <br/>  <br/> area (I'm moving there in a month) for May 19th. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Here are my questions: <br/>  <br/> 1. Except for an occasional lingering muscle  <br/>  <br/> twitch  slight stomach sensitivity  and slight  <br/>  <br/> chest and back sensitivity  I don't feel bad at  <br/>  <br/> all.  I've never had flu-like symptoms for  <br/>  <br/> example.  So is it possible that the positive  <br/>  <br/> Lyme antibody results are from an exposure to it  <br/>  <br/> from when I was younger (I lived in Georgia and  <br/>  <br/> was active in the Boy Scouts and did a lot of  <br/>  <br/> outdoor stuff)  which I beat at the time  and  <br/>  <br/> that I no longer have an infection  just the  <br/>  <br/> antibodies? <br/>  <br/> 2. Is it possible for Lyme to cause the above  <br/>  <br/> symptoms and none others for only a few months  <br/>  <br/> and then go into remission?  Or if the twitching  <br/>  <br/> were caused by Lyme would it perhaps not go away  <br/>  <br/> unless the Lyme was removed from my system? <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Any other feedback is greatly appreciated.  Thank  <br/>  <br/> you in advance for your feedback. <br/>   <br/>   [ 04-06-2009  06:14 PM: Message edited by: gwrisley ] ,6,4,0.196399345,Experimental,Experimental

First it looked like just terrible pain from car wrecks then the fatigue then the fibro then brain fog depression and on and on. We caught Hashimotos that took the doc's just 10 years to find after my constant complaining. We tested for Mold yes  msh 8 c3a very high. Did Shoemakers but did not help. I am on lots of pain meds and sleeping aids. I did Lyme test Negative. But  after 3 different practioners tested me via EDS with Lyme  I decided its time to treat. I have so many of the symptoms with out any memory of being bit. I am treating with  a ND using herbs and homeopathy. I did a Metylation test with my MD and 12 out of 13 things tested were out of range. I don't know what to do with the info. She told me that I should take Gultathine mine was 3.1 range 3.8-5.5 and my Gultathoine oxidised was high .58 range .16-.50. My folic (RBC) was really low 337 range 16.8-21.4. She also advised taking FloPro. I really don't know what to do with this new info. From what I have read here and a bit on Konynenburgs site you want to fix the cycle not just take Gulatathoine. I did a myers cocktail with a Gultathoine push last week. I felt a little better for a couple of days. But  then it was gone and I can't really afford to take these all the time. I just don't know how important this is....if I should add one more long series of supplements......or if I am just wasting precious money on one more thing? Seems if I am to bother with it at all I should at least do the short 5 Konynenburg deal. Any advice or experience would be so greatly appreciated!!!!

366.604131,yes,yes,4067,9310,3,0,0,0,Hello  my name is Victoria and I am a 29 year old mom to 3 children. My husband and I take them hiking nearly every weekend  especially in the summer.  <br/> One June 11th I noticed an odd mark on the back of Matthew my two year old's back. It looked like a pressure mark  as if he lay on something for a long time. It was the size of an egg and fever-warm to the touch. I thought it was a reaction to the lemonade drink mix he had just tried for the first time. The next morning  the mark was a little bigger. I still wasn't overly concerned until about the 4th or 5th day. By then it was about 3 times larger than when it started and I noticed another smaller mark on his leg as well as an odd redness to his one ear  with a red border around it (almost like a paint streak was painted around it) <br/> On seeing this  I called the pediatrician and left a message. While waiting for a call back  I was doing a google search. I came across pictures showing the Lyme Disease rash and Matthew's looked exactly like it. His had changed at this point from being solid red to  as it grew  clearing out in the middle. When the nurse returned my call  I told her what happened and that since we were avid hikers  I was concerned about LD. She put me on hold and came back with a brush off. She said  they  thought is was just a reaction to a bug bite  possibly a spider  and to call back if it wasn't better in a week or so. I asked again about the Lyme and she insisted she didn't think it was.  <br/> I'm not a doctor so was worried I was overreacting. Matthew had been acting particularly fussy recently but is behind on his speech so doesn't communicate what is going on. On June 25th  after the rash having grown to cover his back from one side to the other  and one showing up on his chest and the one on his leg growing just a little (and both of them clearing in the center...the ear cleared up entirely) All of them were very faded by this time. I talked to a friend who told me to take him up immediately  because she was positive it was Lyme. I called back up  relayed the exact same story as the week before  and this time  without even seeing him they diagnosed Lyme Disease. I had taken progression pictures of the rash  so took them up to show them  since at this point the ones on his body were barely visible. They started him on Amoxil right away and sent him for a titer (sp?) test for which I am still waiting on the results (it had to be sent away). When his rash on the back cleared  we could clearly see a tiny bug bite mark...red  raised  and very small.  <br/> We check him carefully after every hike  I thought a tick had to be on for several days before you could become infected? <br/> I am furious that I was brushed off the first time I called in and I'm frustrated with myself for not trusting my mommy instinct and pushing the issue. I am so worried that because it was left go  he may have progressed past the beginning stages and some damage to his little body may have been caused. He seems fine  everything I am noticing that could be different with him could also be explained by being two years old. He has been fussier than usual and clumsier than usual. He has also been more sleepy  this has been noticed by friends who visit also.  <br/> I would appreciate advice on this because I now nothing except what I have found on the internet. If the titer test comes back negative  does that mean the rash was something else? If it is positive  do I just hope the antibiotics take care of it all? What things should I watch for after wards? When the antibiotics are done  is he good to go and healthy? I don't feel comfortable now with what the dr. tells me and I would like to be more well informed before going in again (and we are switching pediatricians over this. It was a valid concern and they couldn't take time to see him. I had even offered to email pictures if they didn't have time for an appointment that day) <br/> Thank you for any assistance you can give me. I will be reading through old posts seeing what I can learn.   ,11,97,0.00887199,Experimental,Experimental

Supposedly it can detect the cell wall deficient form (cystic or L-form) of Bb also.  <br/>  <br/> The test was developed by Dr Joanne Whitaker from the Bowen Research and Training Institute  which I believe is now called Central Florida Research  inc. <br/>  <br/> I have read some opinions questioning whether almost all people would test positive  like how almost all people would test positive for CMV  for example.....except that the CMV would be an IgG antibody showing past infection....and this test detects antigens  not antibodies. <br/>  <br/> They claim it is 100% sensitive. We all know that if something sounds too good to be true then it probably is. Or....has there been a break through in Lyme research??? <br/>  <br/> According to the Central Florida Research Inc website  they test blood samples from all over the world. Tests must be ordered by a physician/healthcare practitioner. Insurance does not cover the test  and the test must be prepaid. Each test ranges from $250-$500. <br/>  <br/> Has anyone on this board had this Q-RiBb test done? If so  was it just for lyme  or were you also tested for other tick-borne diseases? Could you please share your results and opinion?,8,15,0.05785124,Experimental,Experimental
432.2952965,yes,yes,1995,7943,5,0,0,0,I wanted to start this topic for people to share the mental symptoms they've experienced resulting from tick borne disease. It's not easy to admit to or talk about these specific symptoms with your friends or family for fear of sounding like you're crazy. Feeling like the only one out there questioning your sanity is scary though. Just knowing someone else is experiencing (or has experienced) the same thing has really helped me to cope and find assurance & I'm hoping this post will continue that. <br/>  <br/> I think it would be relevant to list your gender  age & diagnosed infections that correspond with the symptoms. Please limit symptoms to those related to the topic & try to be specific. <br/>  <br/> I'm a 20 year old male. Positive bartonella exposure co-infection test which I think from reading info & other peoples experiences that a lot of this is caused from.   <br/>  <br/> Symptoms: <br/> Sometimes I get paranoid about things...the thing is I know that the fears are crazy but still the thoughts come up. Especially at night if I have disrupted sleep/ nightmares/action packed dreams that wake me up. It's just like being extra tired and experiencing so much stress regularly makes you feel more on the edge/freaked out. Random anxiety for no reason. Sounds and certain images (like on tv) being very distressing and causing anxiety that before never would have bothered me.   Feeling really disconnected or almost surreal / living in a dream.   Anyone else every feel like they are drunk/ high absent of any substance abuse?  <br/> I've also experienced this thing where I associate certain things with being sick and now they can cause an anxiety reaction...almost like PTSD. Like for example if I was listening to a certain song several months ago when I felt worse and was herxing bad and then I hear it again now it's like I connect it with how I felt and it bothers me. Same thing with smells.  <br/> That's not exhaustive  might share more if discussions get going.,22,33,0.026239067,Experimental,Experimental
436.0309819,yes,yes,1966,36591,154,0,0,0,Hello everyone!  <br/>   I'm new here.  This site was recommended to me by a fellow lyme member. <br/>   I have been having a lot of neuro sx since May 07.  I was ill with the sx for about 5-6 months and then they gradually went away without any kind of treatment.  Was fine for about 18 months and now they are back and worse this time round.  Currently I've now been having sx for about 2 months.   <br/>   Here are my sx: <br/>  <br/> Dizziness (like rocking in a boat) <br/> Brain Fog <br/> All over body twitching <br/> All over body weakness (especially arms)  <br/> All over pain (espcially in neck/shouders  hands  arms  and feet. <br/> Burning in shins and feet <br/> Occasional hand tremors (very very mild) <br/> painful lymph nodes (no swelling) in armpits and groin <br/> Ear aches <br/> bladder buring and urge to go <br/> cold feet/ sometimes blue in color <br/>  <br/> THERE is a lot!!  However  they aren't all always there.  They come and go and each day is different. <br/>  <br/> I have been bit by ticks and been exposed my whole life as we are an outdoorsy family and always outside camping  fishing  hiking  etc... <br/>  <br/> I've seen two neuros in the past two years who say it's def not MS.  I've had two normal MRI's with and without contrast and my neuro exams are normal besides having brisk reflexes.  All blood work is normal besides showing a past infection to EBV.   <br/>  <br/> I am curious if lyme can remitt and then come back as my sx did?   <br/>  <br/> I just got the WB done by Quest that came back NEG.  However I did show Reactive to band IGG 30 and 41.  I've heard that the testing isn't reliable with Quest and that I should have a test by Igenex.   <br/>  <br/> What does this mean to show REACTIVE on bands 30 and 41?  Could I still have a chronic lyme infection?   <br/>   <br/> I don't know where else to turn?  I'm so confused and scared!!  I hope this is noT ms. <br/>  <br/> Please any help would be appreciated!,13,10,0.085635359,Experimental,Experimental
437.5077414,yes,yes,1502,18107,7,0,0,0,Hello all  <br/>  <br/> I just got my Igenex test results and need some help interpreting them. My naturopath (I ordered this test through her) said that it is negative but I have my doubts. I have many weird symptoms and many symptoms of Lyme  even doctors say that there is something wrong with me but can not pinpoint it since all my blood tests are normal  except white blood cell count which is really low. <br/>  <br/> Here are my IgeneX test results: <br/>  <br/> Multiplex B. Burgdorferi (Whole Blood and Serum): Genomic & Plasmid - Negative <br/>  <br/> IFA 1:40 - Indeterminate <br/>  <br/> IgM Western Blot - Positive: (only positive / IND bands are shown below): <br/> 23-25: ++ <br/> 31:    ++++ <br/> 39:    IND <br/> 41:    ++ <br/> 83-93: + <br/>  <br/> IgG Western Blot - Negative: <br/> 41:    + <br/>  <br/> My naturopath says that since IgG Western Blot is negative then I don't have Lyme  even though IgM is positive because IgG is responsible for the chronic Lyme infection. She suspects that I have some other infection that makes my IgM results positive. However  I suspect my body does not produce enough antibodies  e.g. my IgG allergy tests were all negative even though I do have food intolerances (and a lot of them). And I have many symptoms of Lyme disease. <br/>  <br/> Please help me interpret these results. I really do not know what else to do. I am sick for more than 3 years now  I am getting worse and doctors are not of any help. <br/>  <br/> Thank you very much!,21,9,0.088888889,Experimental,Experimental
438.0406001,yes,yes,2345,38547,13,0,0,0,Hi all. Phew! With my brain fog it took me hours to figure out where the post new topic was. I seem to be bad today. <br/>  <br/> Anyway  a very nice lady that answers here to Dedrato48 invited me here to get further help. I posted to get a LLMD but doubt there is anyone in my area. Olympia  WA <br/>  <br/> My husband had a pale red 3  circumference circle shaped rash on the inside of his arm since last fall. Would a Lyme erythema migrans stay so long without any dramatic change? <br/>  <br/> He had strep throat  fatigue & fever at the time as well so doc put him on penicillin which didn't do much for him. Later I gave him my z-pak to take and at least the strep throat  fatigue & fever went away.  <br/>  <br/> He went to a dermatologist and had useless Lyme screen test done from Quest lab. All his other labs are normal  CDC  liver  kidney  etc. Derm said he is too healthy to have Lyme so he can stop the Doxy 100 mg. twice a day. He feels good on Azith or Doxy.  <br/>  <br/> I have looked at multiple pics of Lyme rash and his looks very similar. Clearing in the middle with a 1/4  pale red ring. I don't want him to get sicker from not being smart about this. <br/>  <br/> I have been sick with  FM  for over 7 years. Antibiotics make me herx like crazy. I did the MP for 3 1/2 years but had to quit cause I had to much pain in my shoulders and gallbladder attacks. When I finally did quit the 25 mg of mino neuro symptoms took off. <br/>  <br/> I thought I was going to die a few nights when I woke up and my brain felt like it was going to push out of my head and my forehead was numb. I have been working up to the Wheldon/Stratton protocol since last April 08.  <br/>  <br/> Started slowly with supplements & finally began antibiotics in Sept. 08. Doing better but I am still homebound sick most of the time.  <br/>  <br/> Read Lyme symptom check list. Like I said I am better now so don't have any severe symptoms. Still have 16 moderate/often and 21 mild/occasional on the list. But if I do anything much or fail to take supplements things rapidly go downhill.  <br/>  <br/> Hope this is not too long. Hope some folks will share their thoughts. We appreciate you are sick too and so hard to think & type. Anything will be great.

446.9276838,no,yes,800,27877,99,9,0,0,You mention that he is lyme-literate... it suggests that he does have a specific reason for suspecting a false positive. <br/>  <br/> Can you tell us what bands came up positive in your son's test?  Also  what was his ELISA result  and what symptoms does he have? <br/>  <br/> While a false positive is very rare  it is not unheard of.  Can you fill us in on more background as to *why* your LLMD would think this?   <br/>  <br/> I am not an immunologist  but if you believe that you may have been infected with lyme while you were pregnant with him  is it possible that he could have received antibodies from you without necessarily getting the lyme bacteria?  That would be one way to account for the presence of antibodies in the absence of disease.  (I'm not sure that it works that way  though!),13,19,0.04137931,Experimental,Experimental
448.2930274,yes,yes,852,4977,5,0,0,0,It seems that constant vertigo is one of the worst symptoms to get rid of. I have had no luck with anything so far. Anyone out there with this symptom ever had success and what meds did the trick. I am on mino and it just seems to get worse and worse. I am also on mepron/clindy artesimin and nothing so far has helped. I am allergic to penicillin. Also if you herx so badly on orals  can you even consider an IV. Do you think vertigo is a babesia thing or lyme? I had a little improvement on babs/clindy alone when I took it for one month  Then added mino and all hell broke loose. I am totally confused by all of this and at the end of my rope. Would a rife machine or hyberbaric chamber treatment help. I need feedback from those who have had this awful symptom.

453.3365747,yes,yes,2029,19053,1,0,0,0,Hi all. I'm a 20 year old college student who recently came home to Long Island for summer break. Six days ago my dad and I went hiking at Connetquot State Park (which I now learned has tons of ticks). I did a thorough tick check and showered when i got home- finding nothing. Well 2 days later I found a very tiny freckle on my hip i'd never seen before. i picked at it and it immediately came off my body  it didnt move so im thinking maybe it was dead. i put it to the light  it was about the size of a pin head and realized it had tiny legs! the body was white/clear but the legs were brown (leading me to think it was a deer tick larva or maybe a nymph? it was flat) I saved it in a ziploc bag. Whats even worse is that two days later my dad discovered two deer ticks on his waistline (dont know how they went undetected so long)but he panicked and flushed them down the toilet. After removing them  we were both left with a tiny red dot at the site. Im extremely anxious about the possibility of either/both of us having contracted lyme disease because its endemic in our area and the ticks were on our bodies (especially my dad's) for so long. <br/>  <br/> I'm very confused on what the next steps to take are. I've spent the last few days researching non stop about lyme disease and know the potential consequences of not being treated or being mistreated. Some sources say go straight to a doctor  others say there's no point until symptoms emerge. We have yet to show any typical symptoms  but I know it may take 30 days. Should my dad and I seek antibiotic treatments to be safe? should we visit the family doctor or go straight to a lyme specialist? How long does it really take for symptoms to appear? Any advice on my situation would be unbelievably appreciated. I'm so anxious about it I cant even sleep- i set up the hiking trip  if my dad were to get a disease from it i dont know how i would live with myself. I would truly be grateful for any input on what our next steps should be. Thank you for reading this!,4,130,0.005089059,Experimental,Experimental

505.4471239,yes,yes,1758,85633,2,0,0,0,Hi all  <br/>  <br/> A few years ago my wife began displaying symptoms which  following a serious investigation into the growing range of ailments  was a 99.999% diagnosis for Lyme disease. Trust me  we went through the mill in trying to figure it all out  her symptoms were ticking ALL the boxes AND we had been through a tick infestation at home  but the blood test came back negative. She appeared to even get a Herx reaction to a course of Amoxicillin. <br/>  <br/> To cut this arduous story short and  as I'm sure many of you would acknowledge  anything related to Lyme or the symptoms of Lyme  it is a tortuous situation for the sufferer and their family  it turned out that  unbeknownst to my wife  following a horrendous bout of rage and psychological torment  along with many physical ailments  she began to recall memories of horrific sexual abuse from her childhood. <br/>  <br/> Whilst she had displayed an unbelievably accurate portrayal of Lyme symptoms  both physical and mental  she had  in fact  been suffering from  Complex  Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD)  which includes stress related symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder (often marked by rage)  Schizophrenia and Dissociation as well as many stress induced physical ailments. <br/>  <br/> Now I'm not declaring that all Lyme patients have C-PTSD! But many people who have experienced a Lyme-like descent into psychological and physical breakdown  may need to start reading up on C-PTSD  BPD and Dissociation. <br/>  <br/> Who knows what a new approach to one's problems may reveal? <br/>  <br/> Best regards to all and  after having researched as much as I have about Lyme  my heartfelt sympathy goes to all who suffer from this range of symptoms  it is insidious indeed.,21,21,0.041237113,Experimental,Experimental

509.5165906,no,yes,3776,52849,4,0,1,0,I was thinking of ordering some... i have heard many good things... I just happened across this.... any thoughts from those with more information or personal experience??  The following is copied from a web site... <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  http://www.curezone.com/forums/m.asp?f=460&i=1031  <br/>  <br/> Along with a book I ordered called  The IBD Remission Diet  by Jini Patel Thompson  came a page inserted later by the author that essentially withdrew her prior recommendation of Primal Defense. Horrified  I searched the Internet and could only find glowing testimonials (most of which eventually stemmed from the Garden of Life company's own marketing.) I could find nothing from a scientific or unbiased source. The inserted warning is frightening. Here it is: <br/>  <br/>  On Page 108 of the IBD remission diet  I suggest that readers may want to try a product called Primal Defense after they've been completely healed for 3-5 months. I learned of this product from numerous readers who wrote in to let me know how well it's worked for them. Since I couldn't try the product myself (I've been pregnant or breastfeeding for four years and counting ) I questioned numerous respected naturopaths  microbiology professors and gastroenterologists for their opinion on the product and all said it looked fine. <br/>  <br/> However  since meeting the founder and president of Natren Inc. (top quality pro-biotic manufacturer ) Natasha Trenev  I must change my opinion of bacterial soil organisms. Natasha is a world renowned expert on microorganisms and maintains one of the largest research libraries on that topic in the world. She has sent me an entire CD ROM of articles  research and clinical data and other scientific studies  (most done outside of North America ) outlining why it is not safe to consume bacterial soil organisms (like those contained in Primal Defense and numerous other products.) <br/>  <br/> To summarize the research briefly  soil organisms (SO) are spore formers  so they make make good competitors for yeast  fungus and other pathogens. This is why so many people taking soil organisms will initially experience very favorable results. However these spores are are extremely difficult to kill  surviving sterilants  disinfectants  acceleration forces  heat  pressure  radiation and many antibiotics. Strong antibiotics -- like Vancomycin -- can suppress certain spores. Spores are so persistent in the intestines that another round of germination may occur after the the drug is stopped. Soil organisms can also adapt loose genetic material and incorporate it into their cellular structure - the ramifications of which are yet unknown. Various soil organisms can also produce harmful peptides  affecting hemoglobin in the blood. It's important to keep in mind that virtually all antibiotic drugs were were initially developed from soil organisms and as antibiotics become more potent  they cause more damage to the host  not just in the immediate gut environment  but systematically as well. <br/>  <br/> In the EU (European Union) the use of soil organisms in animal feed is being stringently controlled and questioned at this time. There are simply too many questions and unknowns to sanction the use of soil organisms for human consumption and one can certainly cannot qualify them as safe at this time. <br/>  <br/> I'm very sorry for any confusion this may have caused you. To be honest  this is the very first time I've recommended a product that I've not tried and tested exclusively myself -- I admit I was swayed by so many good recommendations from readers. Rest assured that I will not do so again! <br/>  <br/> My sincerest apologies  <br/> Jini Patel Thompson <br/> July 2003  <br/>  <br/> Not sure if I should order it or not.... hmmm,20,26,0.034768212,Experimental,Experimental

I've been having symptoms for at least a few months  but could be longer depending on what you count as a symptom and what count as aging.  <br/>  <br/> - Does just this band indicate that it may not be Lyme disease at all  or possibly one of the many coinfections?

579.1390738,yes,yes,943,74324,3,0,0,0,Hi Everyone  <br/>  <br/> This is my first post here. Last week  my 18 year old son became very ill with high fever  vomiting  etc.. He was diagnosed with influenza B and suspected Lyme disease. He was in the hospital ER for two days. To my surprise  the Lyme blood test came back positive on Monday of this week during our appointment for new symptoms such as facial numbness and symptoms resembling stroke. The doctor diagnosed Bell's Palsy caused by Lyme. He is having a hard time eating and his right eye will not close  even when sleeping. The Prednisone makes him feel terrible; very agitated. He is taking Doxycycline (100 mg x 2) for the Lyme. We go back to the doc in 3 weeks. <br/>  <br/> I wonder what to expect. My father  now deceased  had severe and debilitating Lyme. Other neighbors on my street have had similar experiences with life changing complications.  <br/>  <br/> I'm glad this support site is here. <br/>  <br/> Wobie,9,17,0.047904192,Experimental,Experimental

Last year he had 2 pimple like lesions on his face that didnt go away for 2 months. He also was sick for 1 full month with vomiting and diarhea. I am not sure when the lesions were in relation to the illness. No dr knew why he was sick. Along with the vomitting and diarhea came night terrors and Obessiveness and over sensetivity. When the dr couldnt help i figured it must be a parasite and gave him grapefuit seed and wormwood. he got better. Even since then though whenever he has any kind of sickness he get the obsessiveness back and over sensetivity. All that said. He has alwaays had a little eczema  but over the past 2 months he has broken out in rashes everywhere. red bloches. his legs look like he is a leopard. and he has the obsesiveness more and more often. <br/>  http://s612.photobucket.com/albums/tt203/kitykan/rash/  <br/>  <br/> what do you all think?,3,34,0.02259887,Experimental,Experimental
610.4788241,yes,yes,1118,67452,2,0,0,0,Hi  <br/>  <br/> I've read before (I think on this forum) that the lupus rash on the face is caused by Lyme co-infections like Bartonella or Babesia. Recently though I suspected my 7 months on Minocycline could have been the cause  and after a quick Google  there is a strong connection between Minocycline and similar oral antibiotics and  drug-induced lupus . <br/>  <br/> Does anyone have any firm facts on this - ie. is it co-infection or drug-induced ? I was on Mino for about 7 months  but that ended about half a year ago. I'm getting spots in exactly the lupus butterfly rash layout  including occasional hard bumps under the skin on the cheek bones or left/right of the nose. I'm 95% sure this didn't happen before the Mino  and the original tick bite was about 3 years ago. So I'm thinking it's drug-induced  but studies of drug-induced lupus say that the rash tends to disappear with the withdrawal of the antibiotic  so I'm trying to work out what's going on and what I can do about it (admittedly it's not by any means full-blown lupus).  <br/>  <br/> Any info/experiences would be much appreciated - Hugh,13,27,0.030456853,Experimental,Experimental

So my LLMDs switched me to Biaxin and it hasn't made tinnitus noticeably worse. <br/>  <br/> I tend to take most antibiotics with food regardless of what they say because my GI tract just can't take it otherwise.

638.1932072,yes,yes,3103,93408,25,0,0,0,Subject: My Story. Still not sure if Lyme or not...  <br/>  <br/> First thank you for reading this. <br/>  <br/> My name is Sean L. and I am 35 years Old. I am the president of a successful internet company. I have a beautiful wife and 3 great kids. The reason I am starting with this statement is because for a year now people have been telling me that all of my pain is coming from stress and or Fibromalagia. However  as I just mentioned  I have no reason to be under any stress and things in life were going smooth and everything was going well. I just could not accept the fact that my life is diving in a downward spiral because of my own doing. It has to be something else. <br/>  <br/> The symptoms: <br/>  <br/> For over a year now my symptoms have been getting worst and worst. Started with muscle pain behind the left shoulder blade ( around Feb ) and a few months later spread to my left shoulder blade. Continued to my mid back and finally lower back as well. Continuous muscle spasm all over for over a year. About 3 months ago my symptoms have leaped into a whole new level. Continued with daily serious neck tension  headache and the worst of all  ringing in my head ( especially in the morning when I wake up ). My back and neck feel ( and sound ) like they are made of rice crispies. They make a crunchy noise which make me feel as if I am 75. I am mostly tired and sick of feeling sick. If you look at me from the outside all is looking well  I look fine and do everything I am supposed to. However inside I am a mess  I spend most of my day  worrying about my unknown disease and the fact that things are getting worst  much worst. <br/>  <br/> The whole thing started around Jan/Feb of 08 when I came back from a cruise to Mexico. The strange thing is that I got the bulls eye spots on my legs around June ( about 6 months after I started with the symptoms ).  <br/>  <br/> Its hard for me to concentrate on work and find my self talking to other people trying to find out if anyone is feeling as bad as I do? and they don?t. <br/>  <br/> What have I done: <br/>  <br/> I had complete blood work ( no Lyme testing )  MRI of the back  MRI of brain ( which felt horrible by the way )  Neurological testing and much more. Had spent over $25 000.00 in co payments to Blue cross and still have a clean bill of health. <br/>  <br/> I just wanted to post this and let you all know that I thank you for sharing your information and stories as I find it comforting to know that help is out there. <br/>  <br/> Tomorrow I am going to see a Lyme disease literate Dr in Agoura Hillsm CA thanks to a referral from this forum. He told me he will do a special blood test and will send it to a special lab in Palo Alto. <br/>  <br/> I will report back with the findings as I hope my story will help someone. <br/>  <br/> I wanted to ask if anyone knows if I do have Lyme disease  will the symptoms and damage I have is irreversible or may one day be cured and hope for to feel 100% again ? <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Thanks again for reading this and stay healthy  <br/>  <br/> Sean L. ?

I did not understand the disease but in my mind I thought this had taken care of the problem  since my Dr. never educated me about it  or ever mentioned it to me again. I did question it myself  but just had faith in my Dr. at the time  that he knew what he was doing. Anyways  I have been on anti-anxiety meds for about 14 years and am now experiencing alot of arthritic pain  lower back pain and chronic fatigue  that has now lead me to the possibility this is the  key .

719.8200689,yes,yes,1786,2591,3,0,0,0,Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to share their thoughts on this. <br/>  <br/> I have removed an engorged deer tick &lt;2mm this morning that could have been attached a max of 30 hours.  <br/>  <br/> I picked it up in Dutchess County NY  which has one of the highest incidences of reported Lyme disease in the entire nation. <br/>  <br/> Based on what I've read and the experiences of a few people I went a local clinic that takes walk-ins and saw a Dr. this evening. <br/>  <br/> While the Dr. did give me a prescription for Doxycycline {2X/day for 21 days} she did not want to and said she was uncomfortable with it.  <br/>  <br/> She felt I should wait for the rash and treat only after a positive western blot test done after the rash. She said that absolutely 100% of people infected will display a rash near the place where the tick was attached. she said she would not give the precautionary treatment to her own family members. <br/>  <br/> When I asked what risk the precautionary treatment carried  her only response was that I could get bug that develops resistance to Doxy and should I need it years from now it might not work. This seems weird  the resistance would be in the bug  not in the person I think. Any bug I get years from now will not be affected by ABX I take today. <br/>  <br/> Anyway  I'd like to hear what you think. I know many people here are suffereing with the actual Lyme diesase complex and would probably give anything to have had the opportunity to nip it in the bud. I understand this choice is mine alone and won't blame any outcome on anyone's thoughts  experiences or advice. <br/>  <br/> I'd just like to know more before I start taking this suff since the Dr. seemed so reluctant to prescribe it. <br/>  <br/> Thanks  <br/> Chris,12,15,0.05775076,Experimental,Experimental

723.325902,yes,yes,1253,53491,8,0,0,0,Hi: I'm feeling perplexed and frustrated  but hopeful  and appreciative for ideas and support.   <br/>  <br/> I'm being treated for Lyme second time around with apparent relapse after six months or so remission. My only current indicator is CD-57 of 17 and I did have a bulls-eye rash two years ago which I thought was hives and the doctor never saw it(I wish I could change this fact).   <br/>  <br/> I've never had a positive IGENIX test for Lyme or Coinfections. My recent  googling  makes me think that maybe I was bitten by a Lone Star tick as the pics seem to match my rash which I unfortunately didn't photograph(I now realize I should've  of course)  <br/>  <br/> Could that be why the CD-57 is so low even with treatment(it was last when checked after six months of treatment). Does anyone know of a Disease or diagnosis other than Lyme that could cause this low immunity score.  <br/>  <br/> My current doctor  an LLMD doesn't buy into the CD 57 as much as level of functioning and is treating me with aggressive ABX  appropriate supplements for Lyme and the diet  for the past few months and will do more testing soon. <br/>  <br/> I want to make sure that nothing is missed. I really  wannabewell.  <br/>  <br/> Thanks so much for your help!,27,16,0.053811659,Experimental,Experimental
725.7982424,yes,yes,1562,80135,85,0,0,0,I'm new to the network and to a deeper understanding of lyme even though I was diagnosed and treated for it 4 or 5 years ago(can't even remember date of the onset of this traumatic disease).  <br/> At that time I presented with the classic bulls eye rash and symptoms  my regular doc tested (positive) me and put me on antibiotics. I got sicker  after three weeks I was sent to a cardiologist who said I had a normal EKG...but prescribed additional 2 or 3 more weeks of medicine.  <br/> After that course even though I wasn't completely better my doc said we caught it in time and I no longer needed medicine.  <br/> I never did regain my old self. Today I regret not seeking out a specialist  support  or going with my gut instinct. I allowed my doctor to treat my lyme like a common cold  today I suffer for it (lyme. CFS  FM  ????).  <br/> On the bright side I no longer have that doctor and I am fighting back demanding to be listened to.  <br/> I recently changed primary doc again because she continued to say I was just  depressed  and couldn't have lyme again because I didn't have a  rash   she wasn't even opened to the idea that I could still be suffering from that first tick bite. She did however order another lyme test. <br/> No surprise I tested positive  the western bloc also had many poitives but I was told (by my new doc) that on the last four areas I only tested positive for one so I don't have lyme??? <br/> I will be getting copies of test and my old test and taking them to a new doctor.

783.8891666,yes,yes,1597,101262,2,0,0,0,My holistic doctor is treating my family for lyme and has successful gotten my two kids who had it  symptom free.  He has been using a rife machine on us  which I must say  is having incredible results.  I am now immune to all antibiotics it seems - even Doxy isn't working for me anymore.  Colloidal silver went a long way for a while  but even that doesn't seem to be helping.  My lyme all came back when I had the flu in October  which was my first illness in a year since my lyme went away last year.   This last round of antibiotics did nothing for me and I finally quit after three weeks.  He started rifing me every week and I am really amazed.  After the first rifing  my leg and joint pains went away  as did my morning and middle-of-the-night nausea.  However  after a week  it seems to creep back.  He's always willing to schedule a rifing  but really  between my husband and I  and the kids  I'm just wondering if we should get one of our own. <br/>  <br/> My husband had an awful lyme cough which he also cured with the rife.  The machine he has  since he's a professional  is a top of the line $2500 one  which is out of the question for us. <br/>  <br/> Has anyone used any of the cheaper ones with any degree of success?  Really  I am amazed at how good I feel in between rifings.  Neither my husband nor I have ever had a herx after one  which may also be because we're on a lot of natural supplements along with the rifings.  After struggling with this disease for a year and a half  at least something is working. Just curious if anyone has had any success with a cheaper model.,3,60,0.013157895,Experimental,Experimental

We caught it early  he got treatment  and he hasn't shown any symptoms since. <br/>  <br/> Last week  we went to the beach.  Little did I know that those freaking &**&%*( ticks hang out in the sand.  4 days later and he has EM rash.  I took him to our local doctor who confirmed my suspicions and put him on 20 days of abx.  This doc isn't lyme literate  but doesn't profess to be either.   <br/>  <br/> Here's the problem.  Our LLD passed away last year.  Does anyone know of a doc in Michigan? <br/>  <br/> Also  is it possible that he didn't get bit by a tick and it has just reappeared?  I don't know.  I feel so sorry for my baby.

789.0292595,yes,yes,1260,27800,3,0,0,0,I haven't posted here in years  mostly because I don't have Lyme disease  my 13 year old does.  She was diagnosed at age 6 with late stage lyme disease which almost took her from us back in 2001.  Her ELISA was 6.6  sed rate was 90 and WB had all 10 bands as well as a heart murmur  anemia and other crazy issues caused from this horrible disease.  I'm sure I don't have to explain to anyone here  you've probably all have been through it.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> After years of pic-lines  oral antibiotics  natural remedies and a rife machine we had seen a symptom free child and have enjoyed the past 5 years not looking back. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The past 6 months I've noticed some strange things going on and getting worse.  She's recently started eye blinking/twitching and head jerks while watching TV.  She tells me that she is not in control of it.  In the past she had petit mal seizures which started with lyme disease and stopped immdeiately once she was treated with antibiotics. This looks different because she is aware at the time it happens. <br/> Has anyone here heard of mild tourret(sp?) type symptoms from lyme?   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I guess one way to find out is to give her antibiotics and see if it stops? <br/> I'm sorry this is so long.,8,18,0.048034934,Experimental,Experimental

808.5224058,yes,yes,3648,26914,4,0,0,0,I am so glad I found this site. Now I know I am not crazy and there are many people going through the same things as me. I have been fighting this battle since 2002 and I finally learned I have Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis which my Dr. also called anaplasmosis. It has taken me years to get this diagnosis and would like to hear from anyone else that has had HGE. <br/>    The last time I know I was bitten by a tick was back in 2000 and tested negative for Lyme and never had the bullseye rash  so never got any treatment. It was in 2002 that the 1st of the strange symptoms showed up. I started getting skin rashes (mostly on the trunk) that would come and go. My PCP sent me to a dermotologist who wasn't sure what was causing them but thought it might be from an anthropod bite. The next symptom that appeared was I developed mitral valve prolapse and then alot of gastric issues. I had a couple more Lyme tests over the next couple of years and they were also negative. In 2005 I started having tremors  dizziness  and overall body weakness so I was sent to a neurologist who suspected MS and after more bloodwork and an MRI of the brain found nothing. I then had more gastric problems and I learned I have Barrett's esophagus and irritable bowel. In 2007 the tremors  weakness  got worse and I developed an irregular heartbeat. I was sent to a cardiologist for more testing. The echo and stress tests came back OK so I was told not to worry about the heartbeat. <br/>    In 2008 things were still getting worse and now I had aches everywhere  my muscles were always in spasm  I was getting sweats  I could no longer do alot of everyday things  and I lost 13 lbs. in 1 month ( I weigh 106 lbs.) so now I was sent to see an endocrinologist. He scanned me from head to toe looking for a tumor but found nothing. My PCP then sent me to a rheumatologist who told me you don't have Lyme but told me I have fibro and CFS. I developed a vitamin B12 & D deficiency along with low Magnesium and Potassium so was put on supplements. The tremors  dizziness  and weakness were getting worse so it was back to a new neuro who did a brain MRI which now showed a small lesion on the pons area and bloodwork which came back that showed I have Epstien Barr. I was again tested for Lyme and it was still negative. My cardio also did a cardiac cath to check my heart and which came out fine. My gastro did a colonoscopy checking for Celiac disease because they thought I might have a malabsorbtion isssue causing the weight loss but it negative. I was starting to think I might be crazy. <br/>    I finally found a different Dr. last month who really listened and decided to test me for Lyme co-infections and that is when he found the HGE which he says is an old infection. I was negative for the other co-infections but he also found I have a IgA and IgM deficiency so my immune system isn't functioning properly either. He now wants to put me Minocycline for a month along with Prednisone for 10 days. He told me that HGE and cause all the same symptoms as Lyme and feels this is what is causing most of my problems. I am nervous about these meds because of all my stomach issues. <br/>    I am wondering if anyone else has had HGE and had alot of the same symptoms as me. I have heard that most Drs. believe that Ehrlichiosis only causes fevers and flu like symptoms and nothing more  but my new Dr. says that's not true. I am really concerned about how much damage that this HGE has caused by body since it was untreated for so long. I would love to hear from anyone that can give me any info about this. Please forgive me for such a long post.   Madison,10,138,0.005747126,Experimental,Experimental
813.8351324,yes,yes,3874,93909,1,0,0,0,hi all.  I read the post on seeking a doc that I should post a bit about myself so here goes. <br/>  <br/> I am confused about something though  it seems like there is a almost a lyme conspiracy.  Can someone tell me whats up with that and why LLMD have to be secret?  If not here I understand  you can email me. <br/>  <br/> Well  I'm 27  married and we have a 3 year old.  I have felt like crap for a while  but I just thought it was tired from being a mom  stress  smoking  so forth.  I had some random things pop up that I'll talk about later  but I ignored them.  Until I had my first real neurological attack over christmas break....maybe some things are TMI but I need help and not sure what to think. <br/>  <br/> It started around dec 15.  I was at the store and I got vertigo  dizzy and saw spots.  the lights were really bothering me.  I left the store and blamed it on tiredness again.  It wasn't the first time I had visual disturbances.  Little lights at the corner of my eye  dancing dots  blurry visions sometimes  double when waking up occasionally. <br/>  <br/> So about 4-5 days later  inbetween I remember being so tired. As usual  but worse.  Well one day I woke up and I couldn't urinate.  My bladder was full  but I couldn't go  had to force.  I went to ER thinking stone or UTI? (history of stones)  My blood and urine and CT were fine.  I also had the usual pain around ribs that I always associated to stones.  I was sent home and was totally confused.  <br/>  <br/> next day woke up and couldn't urinate again  then all day and all night I was urinating like every 15-20 minutes.  Insomnia... <br/>  <br/> Next day  woke up and could go  but went to lay back down.  From the waist down I went tingly-prickly numb feeling.  I described it as numb because I had the sensation my legs and stuff wasn't there  but it was more tingly.  it went away after about 20 minutes  and I went back to sleep. <br/>  <br/> when I woke up I had terrible balance and coordination.  This lasted for weeks  and I still have this problem although it is better than it was.  a 3 week period I could not even function.  I kept dropping stuff  and I was sooooo tired. I then begain twitching for a few days  whole body twitches  or the feeling of a bug under my skin. <br/>  <br/> The worst of it wrapped up around the 27th or so.  I now feel not all there.  spacy  irritable (this isn't new) tired very easily  nervous  balance and stamina are worse since the attack.   <br/>  <br/> I did much researching and have ever symptom of MS  but also of Lyme.  My neuro is not a good one unfortunately.. <br/>  <br/> My radiology report states I have lesions and abnormal signal in periventricular white matter.  one is 9mm  one is 7mm near ventricles  two 2mm and a 3mm abnormal signal.  I had this done about 12/30. <br/>  <br/> But my neuro never told me this.  He said I have a 'few dots the size of the tip of his pen that he thinks are normal'  He doesn't think I have ms and he isn't very thorough or acts like he cares.  I am 27 years old  you don't just wake up and all this happens.. <br/>  <br/> I do remember a round rash around 8 mths ago or so.  I thought it was ringworm and I used antifungal cream.  It took a while to go  but it eventually did.  It could still have been ringworm and I might have something going on in my brain like MS or something.  Doc says doesn't think it is MS bc of normal MRI  yet doesn't explain to me why there is such a huge difference between their reports. <br/>  <br/> ANyways sorry so long.  I am so depressed and scared and feel alone.  My husband tries to understand but he doesn't help.  I know he gets stressed to  but I'm tired of being told to push thorough it (get over it).  I begin student teaching next week and my cognitive ability has worsened. <br/>  <br/> So that's my story if you read it  thanks and hope to ttys.,5,24,0.037991859,Experimental,Experimental

Some people say it's lyme specific and/or most likely means lyme and then others who say it's not lyme and even healthy people have band 41.... so you'll have to come to your own conclusion. <br/>  <br/> Do you have symptoms of lyme disease?  And if you do  how many?  I think the symptoms you have are more important an indicator. <br/>  <br/> I am one of the ones who believe band 41 means more than many people give it credit for.

896.1562031,yes,yes,641,33242,4,0,0,0,I was curious what the differences are between Lyme and MS symptoms? <br/>  <br/>   To my knowledge their symptoms are very similar.  Is there any key differences in sx that would occur in these two?   <br/>  <br/>  I have not yet been dx'd with Lyme  but supposebly have had MS ruled out with NEG MRI's and Normal exams.  I'm still concerned though.  <br/>  <br/>  I've heard that MS symptoms aren't usually body wide and are not constantly changing.  Where as lyme tends to come and go and symptoms change from day to day or even hour to hour? IS this true?   <br/>  <br/> How can I diffentiate the two symptoms wise?  <br/>  <br/> Thanks.,15,9,0.087719298,Experimental,Experimental

921.0014516,yes,yes,3645,75503,3,0,0,0,I recently found out my cocker dexter is positive for this terrible disease.  He did have some ticks when we went traveling around the country. His only exposure to these terrible things was during bathroom breaks. He is an inside dog  so when I took him into the vet last week  I got the bad news.  I also was exposed to ticks as a child during a cub scout camping trip to eagle cave in Wisconsin.  I had 13 ticks on my head.  Didn't know how long I had them  but I was never tested for lymes.  I am a disabled vet and I have tons of symptoms that could be associated with this disease but I have always just assumed it was my disabilities. <br/>  <br/> I am scheduled to be tested at the VA in Feb.  I hope I am not infected. <br/>  <br/> Anyway  I'm not sure if this is where I ask a question about my dogs symptoms  but I am very worried after getting a re-check this weekend. <br/>  <br/> Any help would be greatly appreciated.   <br/>  <br/> Cocker spaniels are known to have arthritis in the back legs and hips  he is around 10-12 yrs old (we adopted)so I just thought his pain was normal.  then 2 wks ago I noticed he was sort of walking around with his mouth opened.  He had a bad tooth  so I thought this is why so I scheduled a vet visit for a checkup and to have the tooth removed. On jan 17th After running some tests  I got the bad news.  The vet said his jaw was open from the severe joint pain in his jaw.  She went on to tell me that he was also in a great amount of pain  and that he yelped at the smallest of pressure on any joint. <br/>  <br/> she gave me a bunch of meds: <br/>  <br/> Clavamox 125 mg 1.5 x2 a day <br/> doxy oxytetracycline 1 x2 a day <br/> previcox 57mg 1 a day <br/> tramadol 50 mg x2 a day <br/>  <br/> and sent me on my way.  Fast forward to the 24th  he hasn't shown any improvement. To add insult to injury  the vet said that all his lymph glands (neck and back of legs) are all really swollen. She went on to take needle biopsies and told me I will get the results back on the 26th.  She said he might have lymph cancer not associated with lymes  and if so  without treatment he will only have months to live or maybe a year with chemo. I like my vet  but I am not sure if she got the diagnosis right.   <br/>  <br/> Finally the questions: <br/>  <br/> 1.  Should he have had results already with the meds? <br/>  <br/> 2.  Is a painful jaw a common sign of the disease?  I heard it is mostly leg pain <br/>  <br/> 3. My dog can't close his mouth and sounds like he is having difficulty swallowing  but has not lost his appetite. I heard they usually can't eat  is this true? <br/>  <br/> 4. He doesn't have a fever  and although he is not running  he moves quite well and even pulls me while walking.  Can he do this if he is having and outbreak? <br/>  <br/> 5.  Today  he started to drink water like crazy.  Very uncharacteristic of his usual drinking.  Because he can't close his mouth  he is leaving large amounts of saliva everywhere and his water bowl seems to be frothy.  Is this normal?  Do any of his meds above cause excessive thirst? <br/>  <br/> I pose these questions here because it doesn't seem like any vets I call have clear answers or even know how to diagnose this disease.  When I ask these questions  they all want me to bring the dog in.  they just want my money  they don't seem to care that this creature is suffering. <br/>  <br/> Like I said  any help would be appreciated  and I thank you in advance.  Also  if this is in the wrong area  please accept my apology.  It is late  I am tired and in a great amount of pain.  Not to mention I am very worried about my kid (dog).,11,19,0.046413502,Experimental,Experimental

983.5720315,yes,yes,4144,98206,1,0,0,0,I started having a few funky symptoms around august  about a month after one of my pre-hunting season scouting trips.  On one of my trips I was covering a lot of miles in shorts and a t-shirt  high weeds and grass for a lot of it.  Insect born disease isn't very common in Wy  didn't think twice about it. <br/>  <br/> Oddly enough I was at work and got the sensation that  best described  like if you have a runny nose and there's moisture right around your nostril.  But nothing there.  It continued off and on for the day  and started happening more frequently every day after.   Basically evolved into a tingling/numb sensation.  Then it spread to my lower lip  side of the face  and even feels like behind my eye.  It flares up  then fades away.  At it's worst it was every couple of minutes.  No rash or tick bite that I remember. <br/>  <br/> After a week or so of that  every flare up made it difficult to speak for the duration.  Mouth moved  tongue moved  but enunciation was horrible.  I spend hours a day on the phone for my job  so that's not real pleasant.  I started researching symptoms and lyme disease popped up.  I went to the Dr's office  get told it might be MS  might be a stroke or preliminary event.  I told them about being out in the woods earlier  asked if I had a rash  then told it wasn't lyme.  Referred to a specialist.  Had EEG  MRI  and they pulled a ton of blood to test for who knows what.  I mentioned the hunting etc.  So he included whatever blood test for lyme with the rest of it.  All results came back normal.  After about a month  the facial thing was becoming less frequent and it wasn't affecting my speech as much.  Dr. said I might have a virus along a nerve/pathway in my face and to wait and see since it's apparently getting better. <br/>  <br/> Fast forward to now.  The face thing is still alive and well.  It is much less frequent  but it if I'm sitting down and get up to do something it flares right up.  If I'm tired  it happens more often than if I'm really rested.  It still affects my speech  but not as much and I think I've adapted to it and pay closer attention to what I'm saying.  I feel mentally exhausted.  I'm fatigued pretty much all the time.  I feel clumsy and jittery all the time.  I feel slightly off balance all the time.  And the clumsiness and off balance thing is driving me nuts. <br/>  <br/> I've spent my entire life in martial arts and rock-climbing and sports and yada yada yada.  I can support my entire body weight by 2 fingers in all sorts of off angle positions.  Short of a ballet dancer I used to date  I'm probably the most naturally graceful person I know.  Now I'm up on a ladder and feel like I could fall off.  I drop things  knock things over  I typo like crazy typing... it really is making me crazy. <br/>  <br/> I've set up another appointment with my Dr. for next week  but he wasn't overly receptive to the whole thing last time.  So while making the appt. I remembered a PA I spoke with a year or 2 ago after I developed a skin rash.  That break out happened a couple weeks after a hunting trip to Oklahoma.  She was from back east somewhere and was used to seeing insect born diseases.  Figured out it was likely Rocky mtn. spotted fever.  Some steroidal ointment and a few days of antibiotics cleared it up.  Anyway  after remembering the PA I remembered I may not have told the Dr. about having the RMSF at all  it had pretty much slipped my mind until today.  <br/>  <br/> So long story to get to this question.  Is it possible that I picked up lyme or something similar from the bite and been pretty much without symptom all this time? <br/>  <br/> And assuming I'm still up in the air after the next appointment  is there anyone around Cheyenne Wy that might be a better person to talk to?  I started posting this in the Dr. Search section  but it kind of ballooned out of control.   <br/>  <br/> Besides the Dr's  no one knows that I've been dealing with this.  My wife's due with our 2nd child in Feb. and I don't want to add any stress.  So after a few months of 'maybe' having MS or a stroke or whatever  I guess I need to vent a bit.,3,44,0.020512821,Experimental,Experimental

Last July 0'8 I broke out  with horrible hives that included  swollen lips and a swollen face.  I don't have health insurance so I just passed it off as a food allergy and did not go to a doctor.  Eventually after a few months everything cleared.  Now almost 8 months later I am waking up with terribly soar muscles and stiff swollen joints (I am 30  very healthy diet and excersize reg) I went on line to look up soar joints  thinking I may be lacking a vitamin.  I came across athritas of course  but then I read a case of someone with hives followed by soar joints and it ended up being LD.

My next step in antibiotic treatment from Dr. C was claferan shots.

1070.199473,yes,yes,2408,5388,2,0,0,0,I just saw a neuro-opthamologist (who is supposed to one of the best in his field) regarding double vision that I had back in June which lasted a couple of weeks (it took another couple of weeks for the eye strain to disappear).   Four years ago I had a red ring show up on my arm and several weeks later the left side of my face was numb (never had symptoms until then).  I had several tests for MS which all came back normal or negative.   I also had an MRI which showed a couple of spots and the report said these could possibly be due to MS or Lyme.   I initially tested negative on an ELISA test but did test postive on a western blot. I did see a Lyme doctor and did 3 months of antibiotics and have felt fine up until the double vision.  The new neuro I went to back in June said it's definite clinical MS and wants me to start one of the MS drugs.  He said Lyme only affects one eye and not both. This neuro-opthomologist did a very thorough exam today and said that as of today there is nothing wrong with my eyes and he said he looked very hard to find something.  I asked him if the double vision could be Lyme or MS related and he said it could be MS related.  He said he's doesn't think it is Lyme because Lyme tends to be transient in nature and he thinks I had the double vision too long for it to be Lyme.   Although he thinks it could possibly be from MS he seemed unsure because my symptoms have been so mild.  I told him the first neuro 4 years ago was on the fence about MS and he didn't disagree but he recommended that I see an MS specialist to maybe keep an eye on things.   The one thing I liked about him was that he said  if a doctor says he knows everything about a medical issue it should be time to find another doctor .  I don't know if he was referring to my neuro's report in June which stated I had definite MS based on the eye exam and MRI (although no spots in optic area).  I just thought the doctor today was more thoughtful and detailed in his exam. Have any of your experienced this double vision due to Lyme and how long did it last? I'm still not ruling out Lyme until I see my Lyme doctor which is tomorrow.  If he says the same thing as the doctor today I may be more inclined to believe him but I'm going to check everything out before I make any decsions.   If anyone has any advice I would sure appreciate it. Thanks  Lin                                         ,34,469,0,Experimental,Experimental

My daughter's doctor is having a nurse come to our house once a week to give her an IV of salin solution and vitamon B-12 shots to try and help with her symptoms.  She is pretty much bedridden and too weak to get out of bed. She is also taking Minocycline  100 mg. per day.  She was diagnosed with Lyme 2 years ago and also EBV  CFS and POTS. Her most recent lyme test only had band 41 positive.  Her doctor started her on the Minocyline about two weeks ago and I think she must be having a HERX because her symptoms are so severe she can hardly do anything.  She is 17 years old and has been home schooled for the past year.  She is also taking antidepressants which don't seem to be working anymore.  I don't know how much more of this she can take.  When I think things can't get any worse  they somehow manage to do so.  I was wondering if anyone else has tried the IV saline infusion and if it has helped.  Her vitamin B-12 blood test showed that it was on the low side  but not abnormal.  Her iron was on the low side and she is taking meds for that.  It seems that nothing we try makes her feel any better and her dr. thinks the IV and B-12 shots may help her even if only temporarily so that at least she can feel somewhat normal. We haven't started yet  but will probably do so in the next few days.  Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated. Also she took antiobiotics for 2 months about a year and a half ago.  So I think maybe she wasn't on them long enough to treat the lyme.,4,306,0,Experimental,Experimental
1076.47725,yes,yes,960,40018,21,0,0,0,I'm new to the group and have searched the archives for a clue to these questions but nothing turned up. <br/>  <br/> A) My doc wants my daughter and I to take 20 PCRs (at $80 a whack out of pocket). We both have suspicious WB tests and I have a low cd 57 (40); my daughter hasn't taken a cd 57 yet. We have both taken about 6 PCRs and they have all come back negative. My gut feeling is that this is a waste of $$  as they will all probably come back negative.  Does anyone have experience staying the course and turning up a positive PCR ? <br/>  <br/> B) Weird symptom:  I cannot take any vitamins  electrolytes  or anything in supplemtal form without getting strange neck pains in the back of my head.  I have osteoporosis and desparately need vit. D  and a whole host of other bone-boosters. <br/>  <br/> I also have a rather huge heavy metal load and cannot chelate without hellish symptoms. <br/>  <br/> Any advice from the pros? <br/>  <br/> Thank you.,4,15,0.055555556,Experimental,Experimental
1090.655004,yes,yes,2092,19274,8,0,0,0,I've been on practically every abx (besides Bicillin shots/IV Rocephin) without full recovery.  I feel like I'm pumping my body full of these drugs only to maintain a level of  health  (which isn't truly health) just to get through the day.   <br/>  <br/> I recently had a scare and was in the ER for right sided abdominal pain.  Nothing much came of it  though my WBC was slightly elevated and my Total Protein very slightly elevated as well  but Liver Enzymes and everything else checked out okay  so I hope my liver is okay for now.  I just wonder what harm the abx are doing to my body.   <br/>  <br/> Honestly  what do you do when you've put so many toxins into your body but you are not cured?  Continue to let the Lyme kill you or let the abx kill you?  What's worse? <br/>  <br/> I am just looking for support  advice  alternative remedies that aren't hard on the liver.  I'm not sure of Samento is even an option anymore?  Perhaps I'm just one who will never be cured.  I just don't know that I can live with that. I am young - I want to see my children grow up.  I want to be healthy and happy  but I don't know how to obtain this goal.  <br/>  <br/> I've been with my LLMD since 2003  but haven't discussed any alternatives to abx.   <br/>  <br/> Being off the abx for just 2 weeks has brought back eye pain  back pain  headaches  hairloss and a signficant increase in fasciculations.  <br/>  <br/> I'm dealing with severe health anxiety and panic attacks.   <br/>  <br/> So just what can you do?  What else is there that will work?  Is it really possible to live on abx and not destroy your entire body?  Possible to live with Lyme Disease and not be wheelchair bound?  And if just ONE of the dozen doctors I saw actually listened to me and cared enough to not throw wastebasket diagnosis at me  I wouldn't be in this hell.  <br/>  <br/> So with all that rambling...if alternative meds have worked for you  I'd love to hear from you.  Cleanses? Detox? Anything. I am also wondering if I have Candida overgrowth.  Is that something easily tested for?  I truly appreciate any input.,38,21,0.041884817,Experimental,Experimental

I am also getting some slight muscle spasms in the leg and a little bit of pain when I walk. It seems as though  from what I've read  that it's too soon for these symptoms to be occurring and I was wondering maybe if it isn't Lymes at all but something else. Also  another wierd phenomena is that the bullseye rash isn't growing or going away. It is just staying the same. It did grow in the beginning  but it stopped after like 2 weeks.        To make things more complicated: When the rash was the size of a mole  I shaved over it and there was a scab there for like a week. That may have something to do with the bullseye appearance...or maybe not  I don't know. Other symptoms I've noticed have been the normal flu-like symptoms such as slight dizziness  headache  exhaustion  chills  and muscle stiffness.These have almost gone away now. I have had the rash for about a month. I am on antibiotics right now and will be for the next 2 weeks. If it is Lymes  is this the right treatment?,6,213,0,Experimental,Experimental

1188.999237,yes,yes,1854,28418,123,0,0,0,My daughter is having severe jaw pain.  She says she can barely open her mouth because it feels hard and cemented.  She was able to eat  but between her teeth and jaw pain  she doesn't really want to. <br/>  <br/> Her teeth hurting isn't a new symptom but the jaw pain most certainly is.  This has just started over the past 2 to 3 days.  She has been on the Zith and Mino combo for a month.  Could this be a side effect of the meds finally building up in her body or does this sound like a herx? <br/>  <br/> She hasn't really had any herxes at all yet on this combo from what I can tell  so I'm wondering if this is finally herxing for her. Wouldn't she have gotten the herxing when she first started this combo or does it take some time? <br/>  <br/> She is feeling very  very tired as well--more so than her usual fatigue--plus her lower back is  killing  her and then the jaw and teeth pain.  My gut is saying that this must be a herx  but my concerned  mama  gene is worried that perhaps she is getting too toxic from the meds. <br/>  <br/> How long does the jaw pain usually last?  What can I do to help with this type of pain?  Should I bring her to the dentist?   <br/>  <br/> (We were going to the dentist for monthly cleanings due to major plaque building up almost instantaneously it seemed  which I think was from the meds.  She has been very diligent with cleaning and flossing  and this has certainly helped with keeping the plaque down  but now with this pain  I'm not sure if I should bring her to the dentist again?  Plaque doesn't seem to really be an issue at the moment.) <br/>  <br/> Oh  and does anyone know if the jaw and teeth pain is specific to Lyme or a co-infection or both?

1194.400693,yes,yes,5185,5033,8,0,0,0,Can someone please help and let me know if I'm going in the right direction? <br/>  If no what should I do and what am I doing wrong? <br/> In 1995 (I was 15 years old) I was diagnosed treated for Lyme Disease by my PCP.  <br/> I took antibiotics (I think there were 7 of them) for about two weeks.  <br/> My PCP said I was cured after that and seemed to feel better.  <br/> All throughout my life I did lots of drugs.  <br/> To this day I think I was self medicating myself.  <br/> I never really did anything with the rest of my life but once a while have a jolt of energy but would slowly just go back down hill with fatigue and tiredness.   <br/> I think the drug I was abusing were the only things keeping me moving. <br/> I even developed serious anxiety(which i take 2mg of xanax 3x's a day now and is still not enough!)  don't feel depressed but sad  COPD  Emphysema  Acid Relux Disease  have a hard time urinating and pretty much else that is on the symptom list.  <br/> I kept blowing it off until I was sick and tired of feeling this way so I got tested in 2007.  <br/> My IGM test came back positive 2 out of 3 reative but my IGG came back negative expect for two that came back reactive out of around 7.   <br/> My PCP sent me to a Infectious Disease Specialist and He informed me that because I had Lyme disease before it would always show up postive. Is this true?   <br/> He suggested I see a Neurologist because he thought that I may have Fibormyalgia.  <br/> I did not believe I had that so I blew it off since  I did not have Lyme Disease .  <br/> I continued with my life with the same symptoms until around November of 2008 the fatigue followed extreme pain throughout my body and achy muscles and joints  my neck hurt (well my neck has always hurt)  my back  my legs and pretty much everything.   <br/> I have also developed migranes which I have never had before which last for 4 days.  <br/> On Tues June 23 I asked to be rested for Lyme Disease... the doctor laughed at me and said  oooooook .   <br/> Well i went back on June 30 to get my blood test results.  <br/> Guess what?  Lyme Disease again. My blood tests showed my IGG test negative but slightly different only 1 instead of 2 were reactive and my IGM test was the same postive with 2 out of three bands being reactive.  <br/> My PCP said my Lyme Disease was Acute and I need to see a Infectious Disease Specialist and put my on Doxycycline 100MG (antibiotics).  <br/> Im not sure if an Infectious Disease Specialist is the right idea because I believe I was wrongfully diagnosed by them before and its the same place I went to before in 2007 (its the only one around here).  <br/> The same week i was diagnosed again i was rushed to the hospital sround 5 days later with intense pain and loss of mobility.  <br/> The doctor took blood work but said he could not test for lyme there.  <br/> He did a spinal tap in which he said he could not test for Lyme but could test for menagitis.  <br/> My MRI came back negative excpet for a small cyst they found on the back of my brain.  <br/> The doctor told me not to worry about it that it isn't doint any harm and will not get any worse.   <br/> I don't know about you but that just scares me.   <br/> My chest Xray came back negative also.   <br/> I was then injected with 2cc's of Diluaded and sent home with 12 pills of diluaded until i see my PCP this Wednesday July 15th.  <br/> I also have a sleep apnea test for July 14th because my PCP and my Lung Doctor think this is all coming from sleep apnea.   <br/> No one seems to believe im in pain and I am started to think people just flat out think Im just a lazy person... but who can possibly just be plain old lazy for 12 years?  <br/> Im 30 years old have COPD  empysema  severe anxiety  pain  fatigue  confusion  loss of memory  hard time concentrating and the list is just endless and endless.   <br/> My life is on the edge right now and I'm not sure life is worth living for anymore.  <br/> I have a 2 year old daughter and I am married to great wife who works and pays the bills and takes care of me.   <br/> She is the only one I think believes me anymore.   <br/> I saw on this website about LLMD's.   <br/> I posted a topic on this site and got a few responses for LLMD's. Thank you by the way.  <br/> I found one in West Chester  PA who is a memeber of the board of the Lyme Disease foundation.  <br/> He charges 50-350 dollars a visit and doesn't take my insurance according to the receptionist.  <br/> My appointment is July 20th. <br/>  <br/> My question is am I going down the right path? Does it sound like I've been suffering from Lyme Disease? since 1995?  <br/> Why are LLMD recommended over Infectious Disease Specialist? Should I have been receiving antibiotics?   <br/> Am i making the right move in seeing a LLMD instead of a Infectious Disease Specialist? (I am seeing both btw) Please someone out there who has been through something like this get back to me!  <br/> i just want to play with my child  go places with my wife and enjoy life once more like I used to. <br/>  <br/> Thank you all in advance! <br/>   <br/>   [ 07-13-2009  05:15 PM: Message edited by: aubsdaddy ] ,21,18,0.049544995,Experimental,Experimental

We don't have insurance (my husband is a pastoro)  so  I don't want to go to a doctor that isn't familiar with LD  if that is what I have.  <br/>  <br/> Thank you for putting together this site! What a wonderful resource for folks looking for help! <br/>  <br/> May 11  2009 ? Visited Centerville  TN and stayed in a cabin. At the end of the first evening I noticed what seemed like a spider bite. But NO mark  just a ?stung? feeling  and slightly itchy spot on my stomach. I thought I?d been bitten by a spider. Was surprised to see there was no bite mark. Also  the whole ?area? was itchy ? not really a completely localized spot. <br/>  <br/> May 11 ? June 8 ? During this time the itching increased  but still no mark. Itching became more localized. By June 8  a slightly red  oblong shaped spot began to appear at the itchy spot on the left side of lower stomach.  (No bulls eye) During the week following  the spot turned into a slightly raised welt. Itched like crazy  but did not look awful. Kind of the color of a reddish/brown bruise. <br/>  <br/> June 16 ? Welt began to fade. Began having uncontrollable itching on my legs (mostly thighs and backs of knees). Developed several clusters of finger print sized bruises on my left thigh (one day on the front and the next day on the back). And one other large bruise.  No injury and no pain or soreness. <br/>  <br/> June 22 ? Sometime during this last week two other bruises appeared. Itching continues on thighs and backs of knees. Stomach itching has decreases  but is still there. <br/>  <br/> June 27 ? Bruises are gone. Itching is keeping me up at night. Elbows are itching now too. All itching comes and goes. Skin on my legs is looking a little irritated (probably from scratching)  but not really ?rashy.? Small spot on back of right knee and on left elbow look eczema-ish with a few very tiny scabs  but could be from scratching. Slight darkened/discolored shape where welt was is still there  but no longer raised. Still itches  but not as bad as legs.,7,26,0.034567901,Experimental,Experimental

So most of that (if I had any symptoms) is blurry.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> More recently I am working full time and have settled into a routine so I am more apt to notice when something is different.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> In Jan of 2009 I had to stay home from work because I was taking a shower and almost passed out twice while washing my hair. <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  I didn't realize how dizzy I was until it came on all of a sudden. I ended up puking and then headed to bed where I slept off whatever it was that had caused this reaction.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Now again in March of 2009 I feel like I am having more problems.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> 3-12-09 I had to go to the eye doctor because my right eye was really irritated. Ended up being diagnosed with dry eyes and a cornea infection.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> He gave me drops to take for 16 days  along with new contact solution to use.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> 3-19-09 again the dizzy spells hit. This time extremely hard.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I woke up at 2:30am unable to sleep I got up to use the bathroom and get a drink of water. When I returned back to bed I realized I was super dizzy.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I tried not to move because the bed felt like it was spinning all around me. I shortly started to fall back to sleep and I felt my cat jump up into my bed. I could hear her purring and feel her next to me.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I tried to open my eyes and after many attempts I finally did and realized that the cat couldn't be there (sleeps upstairs behind a closed door) Again I closed my eyes and I felt the cat there again.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I woke up that next day at 7:00am to go to work and the dizziness was still there. Just as strong as before.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I couldn't hardly walk and showering was impossible. I just laid on the couch until 1:00pm when the dizziness finally broke. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> - I felt pressure in my head but I could actually function again. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Now I get headaches (bad ones) off and on. They run from the back of my neck up to the top of my head and sometimes I can feel the pounding behind my head.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Some days I feel just fine and I dont have any symptoms but other days I feel like I can't function at all.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> After speaking with my mom about the symptoms of Lyme Disease she says she recalls me being tired a lot in college and complaining of  numbness and tingling arms  hands  and feet.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Once in awhile I get a shooting pain thru my body (in various part) but I just thought that was part of growing up.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Recently I have gained weight again I believed it to be part of getting older and not being as active as I once was.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I also have days where I don't feel anything. On those days someone could tell me our cat just died and I would shrug my shoulders.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Yet other days I am very emotional and I cry over the stupidest things.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I have had bad vision since I was 10 years old. In 2005 the eye doctor said that my eyes were finally leveling off and I shouldn't have much problems with them.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> But it seems like within the last two years my eyes have began to get progressively worse. Some days everything seems really blurry and I can't focus on things. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Also someday I feel like reading anything weather it be an email or a book- seems to take me forever to comprehend what I read.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I read somewhere (I can't remember the site now) that lyme has a  4 week cycle  -(I believe) <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Could it be possible that's why my symptoms come and go? Do you think its worth looking into deeper?  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Any thoughts you are willing to give me would be super nice. I just want a direction to take.... <br/>   <br/>   [ 04-01-2009  08:23 PM: Message edited by: K_ann ] ,8,7,0.111515152,Experimental,Experimental
1274.300578,yes,yes,3023,10765,3,0,0,0,HI  <br/>  <br/> I have had undiagnosed lyme for two years and finally- even though none of the blood tests or spinal tab showed any antibodies- got treated for lyme.  <br/>  <br/> I was given ceftriaxone for 30 days  2000mg s a day. <br/>  <br/> I had the herx reaction 3rd day which lasted a few days  then everything went silent.  <br/>  <br/> On the fourth -last- week I had trouble with my heart. i thought I was dying.  <br/>  <br/> My symptoms were mild but back for a few days after the treatment.  <br/>  <br/> Now it has been 3 weeks the treatment is over and I am having pain at the back of my eye  ear pain  throat pain  and stiff neck.  <br/>  <br/> My neurologist said this treatment was a definitive treatment so she just sent me home and asked me to go back after 6 months.  <br/>  <br/> she believes that i am treated. <br/>  <br/> Obviously my case is not a terrible one when i hear about people with such harsh conditions. <br/>  <br/> However  my stiffneck is killing me  my memory  <br/>  <br/> problems and depression is real bad  my joints  <br/>  <br/> are much better but eye and ear pain is also bothering.  <br/>  <br/> Overall  I am not feeling well. My doc also refused to follow with doxycycline. <br/>  <br/> My doc is a neurologist who also treats lyme and one of the good doctors in Long Island New York. <br/>  <br/> I still believe she does not really believe I have lyme.  <br/>  <br/> The only thing that made her maybe consider my treatment was the elevated white blood cells in the spinal fluid ( it was 11). <br/>  <br/> So I cannot make her understand that my symptoms are continuing.  <br/>  <br/> She says it will take a few months and then I will be fine... <br/>  <br/> My concern is   are there stages of infection. <br/>  <br/>  Since there is no evidence of lyme or coinfections in none of my tests  and I was bitten by a mosquito not a tick  is it possible I might have a mild case that might be cured by 30 days of ceftriaxone and then I will be Ok in the future?  <br/>  <br/> Is this possible  or no matter what it will get worse in the future... <br/>  <br/> My other concern is transmitting the lyme to my husband  is it sexually or any other way transmitted?  <br/>  <br/> Is there any way of getting pregnant safely without taking medication?  <br/>  <br/> I had lyme  got treated  no active infection in my blood or spinal fluid  does this make it safe to get pregnant? <br/>  <br/> I am so scared.  <br/>  <br/> I am 29 and newly wed  never had children  and dying to have babies in the short future.  <br/>  <br/> But now all my world went upside down with the news about lyme and pregnancy.  <br/>  <br/> I do not really know what to believe   where to go.  <br/>  <br/> I am not working and we are a low income family I cannot afford a lyme literate doctor.  <br/>  <br/> So my only hope is the response I will get from here. <br/>  <br/> Thanks already for your interest and time  <br/> Hande <br/>   <br/>   [ 05-17-2009  02:07 PM: Message edited by: mhande ] ,11,7,0.115248227,Experimental,Experimental
1276.156308,yes,yes,1018,58280,1207,5,0,0,I have been a tough sell on the diet thing so far. <br/>  <br/> And I am apparently paying for it  because I just tested very positive for yeasties in the stool. <br/>  <br/> I just always had a hard time believing things I hear without data backing it up. I never knew how they  know  the Lyme loves sugar  and dairy  and gluten  and........ <br/>  <br/> the list just seemed to go on and on. <br/>  <br/> Can anyone present a really persuasive argument as to why for some of these things? I understand the concept of eating healthy for overall health  but what about how everyone says Lyme thrives on it????  <br/>  <br/> I am willing to change my diet  I just haven't heard a good enough argument yet. I'm not trying to be difficult  just being honest. With all the things that I've tried that have failed  I can't accept something anyone just because it's the word on the street. Singleton's book provided a diet  but not a good enough argument. So I'm still waiting I guess......I know that is lame  I'm sorry.   ,43,16,0.053763441,Experimental,Experimental

This doctor isn't a LLMD but thought chronic late lyme could be causing my unexplained symtomns (Trigeminal pain  Fasiculations and Arthritis.)

1289.240384,yes,yes,3103,82987,25,0,0,0,Subject: My Story. Still not sure if Lyme or not...  <br/>  <br/> First thank you for reading this. <br/>  <br/> My name is Sean L. and I am 35 years Old. I am the president of a successful internet company. I have a beautiful wife and 3 great kids. The reason I am starting with this statement is because for a year now people have been telling me that all of my pain is coming from stress and or Fibromalagia. However  as I just mentioned  I have no reason to be under any stress and things in life were going smooth and everything was going well. I just could not accept the fact that my life is diving in a downward spiral because of my own doing. It has to be something else. <br/>  <br/> The symptoms: <br/>  <br/> For over a year now my symptoms have been getting worst and worst. Started with muscle pain behind the left shoulder blade ( around Feb ) and a few months later spread to my left shoulder blade. Continued to my mid back and finally lower back as well. Continuous muscle spasm all over for over a year. About 3 months ago my symptoms have leaped into a whole new level. Continued with daily serious neck tension  headache and the worst of all  ringing in my head ( especially in the morning when I wake up ). My back and neck feel ( and sound ) like they are made of rice crispies. They make a crunchy noise which make me feel as if I am 75. I am mostly tired and sick of feeling sick. If you look at me from the outside all is looking well  I look fine and do everything I am supposed to. However inside I am a mess  I spend most of my day  worrying about my unknown disease and the fact that things are getting worst  much worst. <br/>  <br/> The whole thing started around Jan/Feb of 08 when I came back from a cruise to Mexico. The strange thing is that I got the bulls eye spots on my legs around June ( about 6 months after I started with the symptoms ).  <br/>  <br/> Its hard for me to concentrate on work and find my self talking to other people trying to find out if anyone is feeling as bad as I do? and they don?t. <br/>  <br/> What have I done: <br/>  <br/> I had complete blood work ( no Lyme testing )  MRI of the back  MRI of brain ( which felt horrible by the way )  Neurological testing and much more. Had spent over $25 000.00 in co payments to Blue cross and still have a clean bill of health. <br/>  <br/> I just wanted to post this and let you all know that I thank you for sharing your information and stories as I find it comforting to know that help is out there. <br/>  <br/> Tomorrow I am going to see a Lyme disease literate Dr in Agoura Hillsm CA thanks to a referral from this forum. He told me he will do a special blood test and will send it to a special lab in Palo Alto. <br/>  <br/> I will report back with the findings as I hope my story will help someone. <br/>  <br/> I wanted to ask if anyone knows if I do have Lyme disease  will the symptoms and damage I have is irreversible or may one day be cured and hope for to feel 100% again ? <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Thanks again for reading this and stay healthy  <br/>  <br/> Sean L. ?

1290.81221,yes,yes,907,7714,39,0,0,0,I came down with muscle aches/chills/fever/swollen glands about 48 hours after starting Valtrex last week. Lasted for about a day  and I've felt fine ever since. <br/>  <br/> I had stopped amoxicillin the same day I started the Valtrex  and was not on any other abx at the time. <br/>  <br/> The only other weird thing is that 4 weeks ago  I had a similar thing happen  coupled with a horrible sore throat. I looked at my tonsils and they had white spots on them. So I went to my GP  who took one look at my throat and said strep (no test though).  <br/>  <br/> I called my LLMD  who put me on the amoxicillin for a month. I didn't feel my symptoms get worse after starting the amoxicillin  only better. Probably took me 4-5 days to get back to normal. And prior to that  I had been off abx for about 9 weeks. <br/>  <br/> Thoughts? Could this be Valtrex-induced  or am I in some kind of natural herx cycle?,2,18,0.046511628,Experimental,Experimental

However my recent labwork (from Fry Labs) ordered by my llmd shows that I am also infected with Bartonella. <br/>  <br/> Considering the fact that I am feeling okay most of time (except for some flushing  which could be post menopausal related  mainly at night  and tingling and warm feeling from chest up upon waking)my llmd thinks that my immune system may be able to handle the bartonella without taking any antibiotics. What are your thoughts about this? Should I insist on taking meds for bartonella? <br/>  <br/> I have a follow-up appointment tomorrow with my llmd and would appreciate you recommendations as soon as possible. <br/>  <br/> Thanks so much for your help!,5,14,0.056737589,Experimental,Experimental
1329.732419,yes,yes,703,74999,308,0,0,0,Hi  <br/>     I was diagnosed about 5 years ago with Lyme. I did 18 months of antibiotics and then decided to go the natural route. I was doing ok other than fatigue and occassional arthritis up until now. Until recently when I woke up one day and went to take a shower when I went to shave my legs I realized the front of my lower right leg was numb. I have also since noticed muscle twitching  spasms  pins and needles and hands and feet falling asleep and going numb.I noticed that these symptoms appear to be consistent with the third stage of chronic lyme. I am wondering if I need to go back on antibiotics at this point and if it would help with these symptoms? Any advice is greatly appreciated.,7,65,0.007575758,Experimental,Experimental

What is surprising to me how many pathogens and problems I had not ever thought of need to be treated.  And what is even more surprising to me is toward how many of them we have developed an allergic reaction  usually an emotional allergy  not a biochemical or immunological allergy! <br/>  <br/> Picking the treatment that is most dominant and determining if there is an allergy involved is the key.  Then they can readily be treated and cleared with the Bionic.  Unless I treat the allergy also  I cannot clear the pathogen or toxin.  The body will not let go. <br/>  <br/> The only remaining step is to make sure enough binding agents are on board  unless you want to meet the same neurotoxins again and again. <br/>  <br/> Take care.      Gigi  please explain about the allergy angle here. How do we develop allergies to the pathogens or toxins and how do we know if we have? How does the Bionic treat that? Thank you.

1370.183156,yes,yes,4219,59837,123,0,0,0,Please help me make sense of all this! <br/>  <br/> My daughter has been ill for the past 7  almost 8 months with a chronic headache  fatigue  eye pain/pressure at the eyebrows and behind the eyes  and all over body aches.   <br/>  <br/> She seemed perfectly healthy up until then but had been complaining of being tired for perhaps a year prior to the headache starting.  Since she seemed healthy in all other aspects  we just assumed that she was overly tired from having had a busy day  staying up late  etc. so never thought too much about it. <br/>  <br/> To make a long story short  after many run ins with her pediatrician basically stating that the headaches were all in her  head   she is just depressed  bipolar  blah  blah  blah  all tests are normal  we knew we weren't going to get any help for her.   <br/>  <br/> We found someone wonderful willing to test her for Lyme with Igenex  which came back negative on CDC standards but positive on Igenex: <br/>  <br/> IgG: <br/> 23-25:  3+ <br/> 31:  IND <br/> 34:  IND <br/> 41:  2+ <br/>  <br/> IgM: <br/> 23-25:  IND <br/> 31:  IND <br/> 34:  IND <br/> 39:  IND <br/> 41:  2+ <br/>  <br/> Since then we have had other tests done for her: <br/>  <br/> Lyme IgM: <br/> 41:  1+ <br/>  <br/> Lyme IgG: <br/> 41:  3+ <br/>  <br/> Why are these coming back different now? <br/>  <br/> Bartonella H: <br/> IgG:  1:64 <br/> IgM:  &lt;1:20 <br/>  <br/> B. Dun: <br/> IgG:  1:40 <br/> IgM:  1:20 <br/> FISH:  Negative <br/>  <br/> C3d Immune:  23 <br/>  <br/> I was told by a LLMD expert that she is borderline for all three of the above.  I'm not quite sure what borderline means. <br/>  <br/> What does IgM versus IgG mean? <br/>  <br/> She has done 2 courses of Doxy 100 mg twice a day  1st month was finished up with a 2 month break between the next round.  She finished her 2nd one-month course and has now been off for 3 weeks.  Her symptoms seemed to improve only slightly on the Doxy  if at all.  Her main complaints of headache and fatigue were not improved at all. <br/>  <br/> Now  she is about to start Mepron/Zithromax for one month.  And  again  the doc wants her to then stop and be off the meds for 3 weeks before following up.  I am confused about this method because I've read two different opinions on this:  One  meds should be continued for at least 2 months after symptoms are gone; the other  states that meds should only be used for one month and rotated to avoid side effects. <br/>  <br/> What are the pros and cons for long term use versus short term use?  Does anyone get  cured  by one-month course then time off? <br/>  <br/> FYI:  Prior to this  I've always been anti-medication  so this whole illness is very scary to me.  I will do long term meds if that is what we need to get her well  but I of course would much prefer to go short term and/or solely herbals and/or rife machines--I just need to know what works and what doesn't.  I just want her well.  She is a child and needs to be enjoying her life  not be sick.  We were always so healthy and conscious of envirotoxins  etc.  This is truly ironic.  And no offense  but I don't want to be part of this club--       Also  we are working with a couple of LLMDs--one who is well known  but since they follow different protocols  we are now having to choose who to follow.  How does one choose? <br/>  <br/> Based on the test results above  does she have all three of these TBO?  Again  her primary symptoms are chronic headache 24/7 for the past 7 months  fatigue  and eye pressure/pain especially when tired at the end of the day.  She has never had a fever as far as we can tell.   <br/>  <br/> Other parents  what have you done to cure your child?  What has worked the best for you?  How long were treatments? <br/>  <br/> Her symptoms are relatively mild in comparison to what I've read here on the boards  and I'm concerned that she didn't really respond much to the Doxy--could she not have Lyme after all? <br/>  <br/> I'm not sure now to proceed with this.  Any advice or thoughts from you knowledgeable people would be greatly appreciated.  I just want my daughter to get well.   <br/>  <br/> Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. <br/>  <br/> a Mom With Hope,12,10,0.08538163,Experimental,Experimental

Then they were sore  so I used Clear Eyes Dry Eye Relief when I got home. It helped at first. The next day they were drier  stung more and itched more. <br/>  <br/> Day 3: They really burned  stung  itchced and were clearly red and inflamed. I called my llmd. He prescribed me some Gentamicin abx eye drops. I took them for one day. It didn't get better.  <br/>  <br/> Day 4: I decided to go see a doctor in person to have them examine my eyes. This doctor was certain from the get go that my eye problems were allergies  along with my runny nose and sneezing (which I explained had been going on for at least 2 months straight  and didn't seem to be allergies). <br/>  <br/> She prescribed Zyrtec and Patanol(Rx eye drops)  which I have been taking.  <br/>  <br/> Three days later I saw another dr. because the symptoms hadn't improved and  in fact  worsened some. He said the Patanol was indeed working -  it was working to well . I said (in my head)   Well  that's funny..I thought working would mean it was functioning  serving a purpose  being effective  you idiot.  <br/>  <br/> He said I just needed to take them only twice a day instead of 4 times because they had dried my eyes out. And he told me to buy some fake tears and some Lacrilube for nighttime to get rid of the dryness  which was still prominent  he said.  <br/>  <br/> So now I have my bag of eye goodies  some undoubtedly wasted money  and two not so intellectual MDs.  <br/>  <br/> Maybe I did develop allergies. I know that can happen  and this did happen last year in mid-June. That time I assumed it was the Lyme and I treated it with Gentamicin. I believe it subsided after two weeks or so. So was it allergies or was it the Gentamicin successfully fighting the Lyme?  <br/>  <br/> I wish I knew.  <br/>  <br/> An allergy is a disorder of the immune system  I read. Two types of white blood cells give off histamine which stimulates high inflammation response  which is in turn your allergy.  <br/>  <br/> I also came across this interesting bit while researching (regarding one of the allergy-stimulating white blood cells): <br/>      <br/>  Basophils appear in many specific kinds of inflammatory reactions  particularly those that cause allergic symptoms. Basophils contain anticoagulant heparin  which prevents blood from clotting too quickly. They also contain the vasodilator histamine  which promotes blood flow to tissues. They can be found in unusually high numbers at sites of exoparasite infection  e.g.  ticks.  <br/>  <br/> What I gathered from that: The basophils contain histamine  which send more blood to body tissues(where Lyme loves to hide). There are tons of them at the site of tick bites - the body wants blood to flow to tissues to show that those areas are inflamed and need white blood cells to fight off the borellia burgdorferi.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I think that is correct. And perhaps  whoever wrote that article knew nothing of Lyme and  for that reason  wrote  unusually high .  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Anyways  the Zyrtec gives me a sore throat  a headache and makes me weak - like I felt that gray day I got Lyme (Memorial Day 2007).  <br/>  <br/> So I am wondering if this is what's going on - Zyrtec (an antihistamine) blocks the histamine  which stimulates inflammation. Because it is blocked  free radicals (pollens  grasses  etc)roam freely without the body getting an inflammation notice.  <br/>  <br/> Maybe this would be pleasant in a non-Lymer  but in me  because I have other free-roaming radicals (Bb lyme)  my body ignores that along with ignoring the pollens/grasses/etc.  <br/>  <br/> And so I wonder: maybe the Zyrtec does work  BUT because it works  maybe the lyme spirochetes have a field day and begin to reinfect all my body tissues once again. Thus  Zyrtec halts the allergy response  but at the same time makes  my body vulnerable to lyme (which  as I said  has always badly affected my eyes).  <br/>  <br/> If you've stuck with me thus far  you may how my hypotheses have driven me to this unanswerable conundrum I'm stuck in.  <br/>  <br/> All these miles of words and strung-together thoughts  and all I really want is to know how the heck do I make my eyes stop itching and burning? <br/>  <br/>  <br/> If any of you who read this(and I pray someone does)  have what they think is an adequate remedy  PLEASE let me know of it! <br/>  <br/> I do not think I will take this Zyrtec again. I think it made my brain fog increase as well  and this sore throat and weakness really is identical to the day I got lymed.  <br/>  <br/> Anyone else who has supposedly 'developed allergies' recently after contracting lyme disease  please let me know how they've coped or their theory.  <br/>  <br/> And as noted  an allergy is a  disorder of the immune system   a hypersensitivity to free radicals  which I believe is due to the overstimulated immune system that results from lyme.  In other words  the immune system just wants to fight off everything it sees that it doesn't recognize  after having fought so many invading spirochetes.,12,16,0.056281407,Experimental,Experimental

I was put on antibiotics for about 4 weeks and was never given a blood test.  <br/>  <br/> Over the past couple years I have had a variety of symptoms that I think may be related to my lyme.

It was the first year that I was worried about my health. <br/>  <br/>  Around the same time I had a bunch of typical lyme symptoms  I also had this painful bump on my c-section scar. <br/>  <br/> I went to the doctor. He said it was a cyst  and not to worry...he could cut it out if I want.  <br/>  <br/> My major lyme symptoms faded away for the most part  and so did this cyst.   <br/>  <br/> Fast forward to today. Last year's symptoms came back with some new ones  and I found out I had lyme.

1453.20007,yes,yes,1702,41401,7,0,1,0,So about a week and a half ago  me and a couple of friends went hiking overnight in the woods of Ocala National Forest. After the trip  I got home  went to bed  and the next day I found a tick under my belly button. I pulled it using tweezers  making sure to get the whole thing. Then I searched my body for more. I found about 4 more ticks  mostly on my legs. I pulled them all out  and then I immediately searched the net for symptoms and what ticks can do to you. <br/>  <br/> I read up on Lyme disease and the symptoms  and waited to see if I got any of them. It's been a week and a half now  and I luckily have no symptoms until today  when one of the places where I got bit had a very small rash. Now I was scared  because I had read up on the typical bullseye that you get as a sign of Lyme disease. But this rash is very small  and it's been a small red area for a few days  but got a little bigger today. It's also a small bump. Here's a picture: <br/>  <br/>  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v333/DoubleG316/SDC10345.jpg  <br/>  <br/> Now it's very small  not even as big as a quarter  and all the rash pictures I've seen are huge red rashes. But that's the only 'symptom' I have  I don't have any flu-ish like symptoms at all or muscle pain.  <br/>  <br/> So what should I do? I would like to get treatment  but I have no insurance  and haven't been to a doctor in a decade. And with all the controversy about doctors and Lyme disease  where would I go? There are some walk-in clinics here  is that my best option? I don't want to spend 500 dollars on medicine  but I will if I need to. Is there any antibiotic I can just buy from a store shelf? <br/>  <br/> Any help would be appreciated!,21,29,0.030120482,Experimental,Experimental

1461.118756,yes,yes,1130,29732,6,0,0,0,Hello  <br/> I've been checking in on this website for the past few years with the suspision that I've had lyme disease  but couldn't get a definitive diagnosis until today... <br/> About 8 years ago  while pregnant with my daughter  I was bit by a tick and treated for a month based on a red  blistering rash.  Since then  I've never felt right.  I've had panic attacks  gi symptoms  back pain  brain fog  and numerous tests and the doctors kept telling me it was anxiety.   <br/> I recently found a new family doctor who did a thorough exam and a western blot test last week and it finally came back positive-my prayers have finally been answered!  I never thought I'd be happy to have a positive test  but I am relieved to know that it's not all in my head.  Here's the question...my doctor wants to treat me with Doxycycline for a month and then re check my lyme test after my course of antibiotics.  Will one month of antibiotics really knock out the lyme if I've had it for almost 8 years?  He's unsure if the test shows new exposure or if it came back positive because I was exposed 8 years ago.

1508.353524,yes,yes,2564,49447,1,0,0,0,Hello  here is my story. <br/> I have been sick the last four weeks with a variety of symptoms.  Headache  nausea  loss of appetite  sore wrists  ankles  knees  shoulders  collar area  and hips  chest tightness  mild abdominal pain  lower back pain  sore muscles  brief episodes of rapid heart beat  trouble concentrating  vision problems  fatigue  and a general feeling of sickness.  All these symptoms seem to come and go hourly/daily.  Some days it is very hard to even get out of bed whereas other days I feel ok to work and excercise.  It all started with the chest tightness.  I was x-rayed and checked out with the diagnosis of a upper respiratory infection.  10 days of amoxicillion were prescribed.  After a few days I felt better.  The fourth day I got the chest pain back but this time even worse. Went to see the Dr. and this time they ran some lung/breathing tests.  Everything was fine.  Was advised to continue meds and call if I wasn't getting better.  Two more sick days went by then I went back to the Dr. where they did a cbc  mono  and influenza test.  Blood was normal (hct a hair low) and influenza  mono was negative.  Now I was getting all the other symptoms I mentioned.  They sent me home with a diagnosis of a viral infection that I just was having trouble shaking (I am 29 and in perfect health). By this time a friend of mine had mentioned lyme disease.  His uncle went through months of Dr. visits before being diagnosed with LD.  He said my story sounds similiar to his so I got a LD test.  It came back negative.  I went back to the Dr. for more extensive testing(blood work).  I mentioned LD to him and some things I had learned about it and he dismissed the idea because of a false test.  He said my symptoms indicate a later stage of the disease and the test would show a positive.  He was more concerned about a few autoimmune diseases to test for.  So far the tests he ran that are done are all normal.  To top it all off  last April I found a deer tick on me.  It had to be there for at least two days.  I never got a rash but called my Dr. anyway.  He put me on three weeks of doxycyline even without a visit to him.  I should mention that this was a different Dr. than the one I am using now.  My normal Dr. goes on vacation for the month of March. I should also mention that I am an avid outdoorsman and even my job is 95% worked outdoors. <br/> I guess I am telling my story simply to hear from anyone else who has had a similiar one and maybe for some advice on what to do next and if it really could be LD. <br/> Thanks.,4,120,0.00617284,Experimental,Experimental

1570.561392,yes,yes,5263,96340,125,0,0,0,Hi  I am new here. I have been doing an outrageous amount of research on Lyme Disease lately. I hope this is the correct place to post this. I currently have no idea what is wrong with me  but Lyme seems to be the likely culprit. I know the testing is not very reliable so I am hoping to see a LLMD before seeing anyone else for a possible cause of my undiagnosed symptoms. Here is part of my journey so far. <br/>  <br/> I have been ?sick? for about 2 and a half years. I wanted to get some advice or possible answers from people that have been diagnosed and maybe experience some of the symptoms I have. I don?t know if they are all related but I will list them and see if I can get any help. I really appreciate this. BTW  I want to say that my neurologist did a very good job but he was exhausted and I really appreciate his effort. So here they are... <br/>  <br/> Initial symptoms - burning face/?brain?  temporary (about 2-3 mins) blindness and seeing spots in one eye  feet tingling and numbness and turning purple and not warming up no matter what I did  a rash appearing seemingly under the skin bilaterally on the sides of my knees and the inner part of my forearms and elbows (this rash looks like purple splotches and can be seen clearer in fluorescent light or sunlight)  random moderate to severe pain (burning  stinging  tingling) in different areas of my body and different times (legs  hips  head  face  back)  balance and coordination problems and severe fatigue. <br/>  <br/> I wound up in the ER soon after the symptoms first started with severe burning head  ears  face and back; complete numbness in my arm and a stiff neck. My face  scalp and ears were visibly red. My reflexes were fine and the MRI was clean. While talking to the nurse then painful burning on one side of my back transferred completely over  through my spine  to the other side. They sent me home with a possible diagnosis of Neuropathy and a referral to see a neurologist. He tested me for lupus first. It came back negative but I have seen that the test is hard to get right. I have never had the butterfly rash on my face though (that I know of  at least not the scaly kind  but I do get flush a lot... just figure it has to do with the burning.) Diabetes was negative  negative for MS  negative for thyroid problems  negative for neuropathy although they said I had some problems with some nerves in my legs (??). <br/>  <br/> Other symptoms - sour stomach (new - at least 6 months  all day - every day - nausea but no vomiting)  throat feels like there is something stuck at random times (no burping - new - 2 months  not very frequent)  temporary loss of hearing on one side at random times but comes back quickly(not frequent)  balance issues  memory problems  random slurred speech throughout the day but only a couple times a day  migraines since puberty (about 2-3 a month)  I used to have headaches every single day until this all started - now I have them maybe 2 or 3 times a week  which is a relief. <br/>  <br/> Any responses could possibly be very helpful. I don?t know if chronic stress can cause all of these symptoms or if they are even all related but I would like a medical diagnosis before I just give up and blame it all on chronic stress. The random painful burning symptoms aren?t as frequent anymore but I can?t even work out. Just walking up 5 flights of stairs 2 weeks ago made my legs hurt very bad. I am usually in some kind of pain throughout the day. Whether it be my back hurting  burning sensations  shock-like charges shooting down my head and spine  headaches and so on. <br/>  <br/> I also have epilepsy (but haven?t had a seizure in about 4 to 5 years so I think it may be gone) and Scoliosis (not severe) which my primary care doctor says is putting pressure on my spinal cord. It hurts to sit on one position for longer than 20 mins or so. My back starts to hurt so bad  my legs... I just feel so OLD! I am only 23. It's upsetting. I currently have a migraine which is causing and enormous amount of pressure in my head  eyes (its hurts to move them)  neck pain and changing positions (kneeling then returning to an upright position) causes the blood to rush to my head and cause even more pain... <br/>  <br/> My reason for considering Lyme: <br/> My dog got extremely sick after being boarded in a kennel and coming home COVERED in ticks. Needless to say  2 of them were sucking my blood for an unknown period of time. They both had their heads inside my skin so I had to pull them out. One was in my neck (I woke up with it)  the other in the fold of my inner thigh. I don't believe I got the bulls-eye rash with either. This was about 5 months before the symptoms started. I did break out in hives soon after removing the one in my neck and I got a weird raised rash near the inner thigh tick. Also  I got bit/stung but an unfound insect about 3 weeks before the symptoms. The bite on my foot took a year and a half to heal.

1571.309847,yes,yes,2386,2962,123,12,0,0,I reviewed my child's results  and they are: <br/>  <br/> Bart H: <br/> IgG 1:64--normal is &lt;1:64 <br/> IgM &lt;1:20--normal is &lt;1:20 <br/>  <br/> Babs D: <br/> IgG &lt;1:40--normal is &lt;1:40 <br/> IgM 1:20--normal is &lt;1:20 <br/> RNA negative <br/>  <br/> Not sure how to read these but were told that she is pretty much borderline on all of these?  So she is being treated via clinical diagnosis. <br/>  <br/> We don't know when she got bitten.  The only tick we remember was back in 2005!  It was attached for less than 6 hours and was not engorged. <br/>  <br/> We are treating Lyme & Bart right now  since those seem to be the most prevalent symptoms. <br/>  <br/> I'm not sure when we will treat Babs--treated for one month with Mepron with no significant herx--and she doesn't have what I would think are Babs symptoms  but maybe the muscle pains and headache that won't go away are really Babs? <br/>  <br/> She did have eye weirdness before we knew she had Lyme stew.  She complained of random moments of blurred vision  especially upon awaking in the morning.   <br/>  <br/> She always had floaters that annoyed her  and she always had what she thought were eyelashes falling into her eyes  yet we could never see any in her eye.   <br/>  <br/> She hasn't complained of any of those since starting treatment. <br/>  <br/> Regarding vision therapy:  My son did VT when he was 6.  He had lazy eye and had to wear a patch while doing exercises.  It was a nightmare trying to work with him.  The sessions would inevitably end in tears for both of us!   <br/>  <br/> Our insurance only covered a short amount of visits  and treatment was expensive.  We went for as long as we could but never really saw any improvement.  If we could have gone longer  perhaps we would have see more benefit.   <br/>  <br/> The most improvement he had was with the eyeglasses he wore that kept his weaker eye focused and straight.  He still has a fairly strong prescription  but his vision and convergence etc all seem fine. <br/>  <br/> 2roads  I'm sorry you are having such difficulty.  This is extremely frustrating  especially when no one seems to truly know how and what or when to treat any of these. <br/>  <br/> My daughter's eye symptoms seem to be gone on Zith  Mino  and Rifampin.  Is your child taking any of these? <br/>  <br/> I hope your child finds relief in symptoms soon.,15,10,0.083135392,Experimental,Experimental

Amazingly well. The tincture can't mobilize metals for me anymore but the homeopathic is going much deeper. <br/>  <br/> Same as chlorella. Real weed is good (I'm still on high amounts a day as I am flushing metals and other toxins) but my daughter is using chlorella homeopathic as her MAIN chelator now.  <br/>  <br/> Nothing else I have at home tests good for her  except for chlorella homeopathic. She still takes whole 'herb' chlorella to bind though  together with bear garlic. <br/>  <br/> I never heard of these two substances taken homeopathically for heavy meatal chelation  but as they are working  well we're continuing. <br/> ---- <br/>  <br/> John  I wish you good luck with your homeopath and treatment. I know classical homeopaths are afraid of many combinations and I do hope he got the good substance for you.  <br/>  <br/> I usually give a deadline for a practioner  like minimum 3 months (but best is 6 months if you can stand) and follow what they suggest.  <br/>  <br/> I had been on the classical approach with a NON LYME literate much before I fell sick with lyme. When I fell sick with it  I continued doing it  but I couldn't wait too long to get results as I was too bad. I needed herbs to continue killing -detoxing.  <br/>  <br/> But if you are not as bad and you can wait  I guess he may be right  that such miasmatic remedies would work best if taken alone. <br/>  <br/> Did you get a Bionic back with you? <br/>  <br/> -- <br/> Joey  Bejoy and all: thanks for posting about ozone.

No improvement.   <br/>  <br/> Nov 07 The lesions spread up my body and my lips were raw  inflamed  scabbing  and would bleed if I licked my lips  the doctor thought it was Herpes (I've had  cold sores  before  I thought at this point he was just guessing)  he prescribed Valtrex pills and some Herpes ointment for lips. No improvement.   <br/>  <br/> Dec 07 I went back to my doctor as the lesions seemed worse to me and weren?t healing  labs all looked fine except for the continuous elevated white blood cell count and elevated Absolute Neutrophils  he sent me to a dermatologist.  <br/>  <br/> The dermatologist took a ?punch biopsy? of one lesion which was a new one appearing just that morning. Lab results said ?possible insect bite/reaction?.  <br/>  <br/> In Feb 2008 Dermatologist prescribed ?Cephalexin? 500mg 3 times daily and ?Triamcinolone/Sarna 1:2? ointment to apply to all skin areas 3 times daily.  <br/>  <br/> I am still on this antibiotic and using the ointment.  <br/>  <br/> He ruled out lice  scabies  eczema  psoriasis  Lyme disease (test results said negative)  allergies  etc??He said he is not sure what the lesions are being caused by.  <br/>  <br/> Mar 08 I was sent to an Infectious Disease Specialist  labs with him were negative for HIV  Hepatitis A  B  & C  rheumatoid arthritis  etc? <br/>  <br/> This Doctor felt the skins lesions were due to the small bowel resection causing a mal-absorption of nutrients and vitamins  specifically the ?B? vitamins.  <br/>  <br/> He suggested I take  extra  vitamins. <br/>  <br/> Current situation:  <br/>  <br/> I am still taking the Cephalexin 3 time per day  using the Triamcinolone/Sarna ointment 4-5 times each day  and I am taking 5 times the normal recommended daily amounts for all ?B? vitamins and take 5 multi-vitamins so my body will at least absorb some of them.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Since increasing the vitamins the majority of the lesions are slowly healing now; a few new small ones have appeared  however  about ten of them are still not healing.  <br/>  <br/> Yesterday I decided I could not take the pain of one of the lesions which is on my wrist.  <br/>  <br/> No matter what ointments I used  or alcohol or hydrogen peroxide  it just wouldn?t stop hurting.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I used tweezers to dig into the lesion  removed a small partial scab  and all kinds of nasty looking stuff came out  not any puss  but lots of blood  and it hurt like hell  and when I was done removing this stuff  the pain was gone and the bleeding had stopped. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> When I was cleaning up from this ?home surgery? on my wrist  I noticed what looked like some of the spots of blood would ?jump?.  <br/>  <br/> I used the tweezers to poke at the stuff that came out of the lesion and anything that wasn?t stuck to the napkins would ?jump? across the napkin.  <br/>  <br/> I used a magnifying glass to look closer but I couldn?t determine if the ?jumping? things were bugs or not.  <br/>  <br/> There aren?t any legs or antennae visible. When I poured hydrogen peroxide on them  the bubbled and made the red blood disappear leaving what looked like pieces of tissue.  <br/>  <br/> What could the  jumping  tissues be? It is possibly Lyme disease with co-infection?  <br/>  <br/> I feel the numerous doctors I have seen don't know what they are doing if they can't figure this out after so many months so I am trying to  find the cure  on my own. Any help is very appreciated !!! <br/>   <br/>   [ 19. April 2008  05:36 PM: Message edited by: Gromit7717 ] ,11,11,0.080149115,Experimental,Experimental
1650.589819,yes,yes,1777,38580,1,0,0,0,Hi  <br/>  <br/> Three weeks ago I was diagnosed with Lyme Disease as well as the co-infection Ehrlichiosis and I'm now being treated by an LLMD. I am  however  starting to doubt whether the symptom I suffer from the most could be caused by Lyme or if it's something else entirely such as depression and/or anxiety. <br/>  <br/> The primary symptom I speak of is this chronic  head  problem which I've had since August/September 2008. Basically  my head always feels very  drugged    woozy   and  drunk-like  and also  heavy    full  and  cloudy.  It's a really horrible feeling which rarely lets up. So far the Doxy I'm taking hasn't changed anything but I know that the treatment takes time. <br/>  <br/> Based on what I've read  this symptom doesn't really sound like  neuro  Lyme since my cognitive abilities seem okay (e.g.  no slurring of words  no disorientation etc.) Rather what I experience is much more of a debilitating physical illness. Have you heard of or known any Lyme patients who have these particular head symptoms instead of the more common cognitive-related ones? I know that Lyme can cause dozens upon dozens of different symptoms but I've been hard-pressed to find anyone who has my exact symptoms.  <br/>  <br/> The other symptoms I have seem more in line with common Lyme Disease maladies  namely sporadic muscle twitching and occasional muscle/joint pain. <br/>  <br/> After spending several months trying to find out what was wrong with me (i.e.  seeing several doctors  having many tests done)  I'm happy to finally get a diagnosis. However  I'm still not convinced that this particular head symptom could be caused by Lyme and/or Ehrlichiosis. Any insight you might have into this matter would be greatly appreciated. <br/>  <br/> Many thanks  Ami,6,21,0.04109589,Experimental,Experimental

She even knew what I needed before I asked!  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Now  it's Tuesday and the 36 hour bite is blistered. Can anyone here ease my mind?  <br/>  <br/> I SO want to scrape by with a close call and a lesson learned and nothing more. Any insights are greatly appreciated. <br/>  <br/> I'm so sorry I didn't know how to make this easier to read.     <br/>   <br/>   [ 06-03-2009  04:54 PM: Message edited by: LymeLearned ] ,14,10,0.081300813,Experimental,Experimental

It's not a huge volume  but it's enough that I often spit a little when I speak.  Of course this is annoying and kinda gross. <br/>  <br/> I don't remember ever having to swallow saliva regularly before.  Seems like it just slid down most of the time  without me noticing it.  Now I have to make a conscious effort to swallow to avoid too much moisture. <br/>  <br/> Are any of you taking Iodoral?  I've been taking it more regularly in the last month or two.  Probably about the same length of time that I've noticed the increased saliva. <br/>  <br/> I finished a bottle recently and decided to actually read the little paper insert in the bottle.  It said one of the things to watch out for is extra saliva production  and to call your doctor if you notice that.  Hmmm. <br/>  <br/> Maybe I will cut back on the dosage and see if that changes anything. <br/>  <br/> Nutmeg,15,12,0.06779661,Experimental,Experimental

I have had lots of neurological symptoms starting in March 2008 including vertigo  brain fog  fatigue  body aches  and muscle twitches.

1749.515771,yes,yes,2720,5603,3,0,0,0,Hello!  I'm here because I've been unable to find someone to listen to me anywhere else.  I'm sad and frustrated.   <br/>  <br/> Here's a little back story. Last summer  I was bit by 2 ticks (a week apart from eachother) and only put on 1 days worth of antibiotics. I began to have bouts of muscle and joint pain and headaches (never this bad) but didn't think anything of it. I was diagnosed on two separate occasions as having costochondritis (inflamation of the chest wall) because I was having chest pain and my heart and everything else was fine.  <br/>  <br/> For the past 2 weeks  I've been suffering from unexplained sweats  fatigue  swollen glands in my neck  upset stomach  diarrhea  chest pain & rib soreness  cough that wakes me up in the middle of the night  joint pain (neck  back  shoulders  elbows  knees  ankles  fingers and toes)  swelling (knees & feet)  stiffness of my joints including my neck and back  muscle pain and charlie horse-like cramps in my arms and legs  headache  numbness  burning & stabbing sensations  shooting pains  double/blurry vision  light sensitivity  ringing in my ears  ear pain  sound sensitivity  dizziness  difficulty in thinking  diffculty with concentration/reading   <br/> poor short term memory  mood swings/depression   <br/> disturbed sleep (2-3 hour intervals  restless legs  creepy crawly feelings) <br/>  <br/> My white blood count came back and 13.5 (should be under 10.8) and neutrophils came back at 11 192 (should be under 7800). My family doctor started me on abx because of the infection showing up with the white blood cell count. She has said she believed it was Lyme from the get go. <br/>  <br/> I'm finding it hard to decipher the Lyme tests. The area that says Lyme AB says 1.66 (Out of Range). Ehrlichia  Babesia Microti  etc. all show negative (In Range). The Western Blot came back as well and here is where I get confused: <br/>  <br/> Lyme Disease AB (IgM) WB Negative <br/>  <br/> Then  below that it says: <br/>  <br/> 23 KD (IgM) Band - Non Reactive <br/>  <br/> 39 KD (IgM) Band - Non Reactive <br/>  <br/> 41 KD (IgM) Band - Reactive <br/>  <br/> Lyme AB - 1.66  Positive (Out of Range) <br/>  <br/> Today  I go to a supposed LLMD who says I don't have Lyme and that he thinks I have viral meningitis or a summer virus and tells me to continue the antibiotics in case it IS Lyme.    He said because the WB didn't back up the Lyme AB screen that it means I don't have it.  Does this make any sense to anyone?  I'm at my wit's end because I feel like there's no one out there who is willing to listen to me... <br/>  <br/> I went to a Rheumatologist who told me that she believes it's Fibromyalgia.

1788.409749,yes,yes,1833,28281,16,0,0,0,Hello-I have been suffering from a constant daily headache (as in no relief) for the past nine months EXCEPT when I was in Israel for 2 weeks in August (which no one can explain).  <br/>  <br/> MRI/MRA/CT show nothing 'unusual' except for a small 'scar' on my brain which causes me to 'fail' my field of vision test but the neuro-ophthalmologist said I was probably born with it and not to be concerned.  <br/>  <br/> I have no 'classic' migraine symptoms-no nausea  sensitivity to light  sound or smell  I basically can function as a 'normal' person  just in a great deal of pain.  <br/>  <br/> I've been to several headache clinics and been through many of the abortive/preventative migraine meds  none of which have done much good. Their current diagnosis is new daily persistent headache. <br/>  <br/> I have not had an LP  as it is painful and expensive  and I have no symptoms to suggest that it would be Pseudotumor Cerebri  according to the docs. <br/>  <br/> I have TMJ  but according to the specialist  it is not causing my headaches.  <br/>  <br/> I 'had' lyme when I was about 17 (I'm 26)  it was discovered as a fluke during a blood work up  and I was treated with antibiotics and thought I was 'fine' since I never really had symptoms and had no rash/bite. As part of the headache workup they retested for lyme  and the test came back negative. I'm currently working with a 'functional' medicine doctor who have my organic acids tested  and I came up low for B12. She mentioned that lyme could be a possibility  even if the 'standard' tests weren't showing it.  <br/>  <br/> You all seem so knowledgeable that I though I'd see if this sounded familiar to anyone as it relates to lyme-I know you aren't doctors  but very well informed patients  and honestly I think you probably help a lot more people than most doctors!,15,20,0.043076923,Experimental,Experimental

Hubby had about half as many of the rings as you -- but the rings inside his cells are only about half as large as the rings on your slide. He also had the dots on the outside of the cells. <br/>  <br/> Hubby's rings were all in the center of the cells and look very similar in size to the one in the center of the link posted by Amanda except that that ring is off center. <br/>  <br/> His slide said -- moderate coccobacilli adherent to erythrocytes indicated by yellow arrows. Moderate protozoal forms seen indicated with red arrows. Differential:  Coccobacilli -- Bartonella spp. Protozoans -- Babesia spp. <br/>  <br/> The rings but not the dots went away before the 2nd slide in August  2007. He treated with low dose quinine/clindamycin for 4 months and then did 2 rounds of primaquine/chloroquine in between the 2 slides. Also 6 weeks of IV Primaxin.  <br/>  <br/> I am really curious as to what your primary symptoms are and what if any treatment you have had for Bart or Babs prior to the slide. <br/>  <br/> Do you have any other test results -- antibody or PCR which indicate either babesia or bartonella? <br/>  <br/> While the whole Fry thing is somewhat confusing I thought everyone who had the rings (many do not have this finding) had been labeled as having babesia or a protozoa -- at least until very very recently. <br/>  <br/> Bea Seibert      I have a positive antibody test for Bartonella that says I have been exposed. I believe it was through IgeneX. <br/>  <br/> At the bottom of my sheet it says that the slide is distinctive of either Hemobartonella or Mycoplasma.  <br/>  <br/> I have had no treatment for bartonella prior to the slide test.

I?d forgotten I even had them. <br/>  <br/> Are you still drinking the Prill water?  Did you get your beads from Global Light (globalight.net)? <br/>  <br/> I guess I got mine well over a year ago?. I bought the Prill Beads + the Cosmic Energy Stones as a package.  I also bought one of those basic Stirwands?..  I didn?t tell anybody I got this stuff because it sounds so woo-woo and kooky ??. <br/>  <br/> Unlike you  though  I didn?t notice any difference from any of them.  I tried the Stirwand first for a couple of weeks  then I made the Cosmic/Prill Water and didn?t notice anything from that  either.  I can?t remember how long I tried this stuff  though. <br/>  <br/> Bob  what kind of water did you use with your Prill Beads?  (Distilled  filtered  RO  etc.) <br/>  <br/> I think I should try all this stuff again.  I can?t remember enough about what else I was doing at the time  so I should just start over. <br/>  <br/> There?s a PDF file at Global Light about the Cosmic Energy Stones that got me interested.  Here are a couple of excerpts: <br/>  <br/>      quote:   Cosmic Water emits infrared energy. Infrared energy energizes water molecules in the body and improves oxygen levels. Infrared energy warms fats  chemicals and toxins in the blood to assist in eliminating them and also improves the flow of blood. It also helps reduce body acidity??.  <br/>  <br/> The Cosmic Energy Stones modify water in five main ways:  <br/> - Making water more alkaline-producing when processed by the body  <br/> - Flooding water with a wavelength of 656 nanometers (far infrared) energy  <br/> - Reducing surface tension more than 8 percent  <br/> - Increasing water?s Life Force energy and changing water?s atomic spin.  <br/> - Removing deuterium oxide from water.  <br/>       Cosmic Energy Stones: <br/>  http://www.globallight.net/pdf/CES-Bklt1-06.pdf  <br/>  <br/> I thought it was interesting that one person at Curezone said the Prill Beads stopped working after awhile. <br/>  <br/> I?ll go read the line from your second post?..,1051,10,0.081920904,Experimental,Experimental
1847.489938,yes,yes,2462,42420,86,0,0,0,I had to get my midline pulled yesterday and I am ****ed. <br/>  <br/> On Monday I started my IV rocephin via a midline that was inserted in my home by a nurse. The nurse was amazing and everything went really well. I had some pain and soreness from the insertion but it was nothing big and I just figured it would pass.  <br/>  <br/> The line always flushed well for the 5 days it was in and I'm tolerating the meds great. <br/>  <br/> Yesterday (Day 5) I  began having intense excruciating pain in my bicep area above the lines insertion point. I could not straighten out my arm and my entire upper arm was painful to the touch. It was also red and swollen 1cm above normal (when the nurse measured it) If I even graze it with a shirt  tears would automatically roll down my face. It is horrific pain.  <br/>  <br/> I called the nursing company and they came to check on it. They called my LLMD and he said to get to the ER. I went to the ER and I had a normal white count and no clots (checked through sonogram) They called my LLMD again and he told them I should have the line out. I am not even going to begin to explain how crappy the hospital doctor was. Also  every IV they put in me in the hospital bed hurt like bloody hell. I was screaming in the ER because it hurt so much ? this is very unlike me as I am used to IVs and have a very high pain tolerance.  <br/>  <br/> Today the nursing company came to put in a peripheral/heplock for the time being. They put it in the opposite arm from the former midline. They inserted it in the crook of my elbow. I could not move my arm even an inch. If I moved my arm from its straight position the IV would pinch my arm to the point of pain once again. I spent 6 hours with the heplock until I called the nursing company and they told me to take it out.  <br/>  <br/> Now I have to call my LLMD tomorrow and ask him what the hell we are going to do now. I don't even know what my options are anymore. The nursing company said they can send a nurse to put in another heplock ? but the doctor needs to call it in.  <br/>  <br/> I don't want to be one of those annoying patients. <br/>  <br/> I am in excruciating pain. I am so upset that I am taking another step backwards. It seems that nothing is working out the way it is supposed to. I don't understand why I am in so much pain from an IV. <br/>   <br/> I am so lost. <br/>  <br/> -Amanda <br/>   <br/>   [ 04-12-2009  11:59 PM: Message edited by: AmandaM ] ,10,20,0.044897959,Training,Experimental

Been misdiagnosed with mental illness for the last 9 years  but about 8 months ago my body started deteriorating fast  dropped a lot of weight  ect. <br/>  <br/> I found an okay LLMD about 2 and a half hours away  but am not being treated aggressively  and have not been tested or treated for possible coinfections. <br/>  <br/> Have yet to do an Igenex western blot  but while I was in the hospital for a week earlier this month  tested negative with an Elisa test as I expected.  I want to do the Igenex test but money is a huge issue. <br/>  <br/> I have Indiana State Medicaid though. <br/>  <br/> Have done a CD57 test that came back an 11  which I know is very low.  Also test with having high levels of lead and aluminum.  Weak antibody showing for candida.  No tests for coinfections done. <br/>  <br/> Having many neuro problems so it's been hard for me to figure out what to do  or to communicate clearly online even which has held me back  but I'm determined to make some more progress. <br/>  <br/> I have been on 300mg of Doxy for about 6 weeks now  and started 1750mg of amoxicillin a day last week along with the doxy. <br/>  <br/> I was recently in the hospital for a week when I lost all control of my body and slid down the stairs  and couldn't move or talk for two days  but have slowly gotten most functions back.  I also had a seizure while in the hospital and coded and all that. <br/>  <br/> They of course threw out the diagnosis of Lyme and had to have phsyc consults and all that fun stuff  with an infectious disease doc   completely ruling out Lyme   from their Elisa in house test  and with looking up diagnostics online  haaaaa.  Yeah  I know the whole deal with everything  and it has been the same as most deal with  with doctors having no clue what they are talking about. <br/>  <br/> I'm looking at my next step with things  I have an appointment wednesday with my current LLMD  but she's not a specialist and I have been feeling the need to go to a full specialist  have been thinking of Dr. C in MO  but money is a major issue  and I'm having to convince family of the need to take drastic measures of traveling that far. <br/>  <br/> Brain fog is terrible  so I have trouble sorting through everything and figuring out what I'm even doing most of the time.

This might best be a chore for someone else in the future. <br/>  <br/> As for the rheumatologist  some of the them do not believe in CFS.  They like the label of fibromyalgia or depression. <br/>  <br/> --- <br/>  <br/> When you say   Something isn't adding up.  <br/>  <br/> Really  this is what lyme is - it's all adding up to hallmark lyme patterns.   It is not a walk in the park and neither is treatment. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I know you don't want to have lyme and that you are only into 3 weeks of treatment but  really  this is a horrible disease and it's rough. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> If you can recognize that and give yourself a break  it will be easier than being surprised over and over.   I don't want to be negative - and you can get through this - but repeatedly you remark about how this just can't be lyme and stuff does not add up. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> All the events you describe fit lyme symptoms to a tee.   Perhaps the fact that the established medical community is so in the dark makes it harder to acknowledge.  I know I still can't believe something can be so uniquely devastating but it's not common knowledge to the world. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Be kind to yourself.  This can get better. <br/>  <br/> ====== <br/>  <br/> You asked:  What would you do?  <br/>  <br/> I would NOT see the ID doctor or the rheumatologist. <br/>  <br/> I would see the psychiatrist but only after he reads Pam Weintaub's (sp?) blog with Psychology Today and her book   Cure Unknown  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I hate that you are forced to see a psychiatrist - I think a psychologist would be a more open choice as most psychiatrists just like to prescribe meds.  They do not do counseling and may not understand the adrenal dysfunction and fatigue.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Can you ask for a sleep study?

I had two brain MRI's which showed 2 white lesions that grew from the size of peas to silver dollars. The radiologist said these were possible  lyme lesions . The neurologist said it was nothing. I had only had 1 blood test 2 years ago in the very beginning which was negative so I have never been treated for lyme. I met a wonderful person a few days ago who took one look at me and swore I have advanced lyme - she is being treated for it. I know I will be diagnosed with fibro because you can see the knots on my arms. I am also having skin and mouth problems. I thought these were from the meds. I have terrible itching all over my body especially my flank area - this started a couple of months ago. I have linchen looking like things all over. I have erosive lichen planus in my mouth and it peels and erodes inside my cheeks. I am on so many meds. The neuro says I have post spinal cord neuropathy but other neuros say I never had a spinal contussion. I also had evoked potentials and they were abnormal in my legs and my right eye. I just feel so sick - I sleep all the time and the pain is getting worse every day.  I did have a rash on my arm after an epidural injection last summer but is was just a big round rash - not a bull's eye.  I live in Delaware County  Pennsylvania. Can anyone give me some advice or info? Thanks. I am also near Chester County.,10,191,0.002604167,Training,Training

Of course I've done some research and ankylosing spondylitis keeps coming up. <br/>  <br/> I see an LLMD and have been treated for lyme and coinfections for 10 years. Does anyone know if spondylitis is common among lymies  if the lyme is under control perhaps this test would return to negative? <br/>  <br/> Reading about it  spondylitis is a pretty scary  diagnosis and I don't know if the treatments for spondylitis would be contraindicated with lyme. <br/>  <br/> I see my LLMD about 2 weeks after the Rheumatologist and will discuss any proposed treatment with him before I start anything but I was wondering if anyone has any experience or input with a positive HLA- B27 test or AS. <br/>  <br/> Thankyou,2,13,0.0625,Training,Training

I have been treated extensively for Lyme  and am in remission (knock on wood!) and consider myself extremely lucky.  I do have some residual effects  though  that make me think I have ADD or ADD-like symptoms  whether or not related to Lyme.  I guess I'm trying to sort out whether it's ADD (whether or not caused by my Lyme) or whether it is the residual effect of the Lyme (I had major cognitive impairments from my Lyme resulting from brain swelling).  Maybe in the end it doesn't matter  but either way I think I need help with it.  <br/>  <br/> If people have been diagnosed with ADD  what have your symptoms been?  Do your LLMDs think it's connected to your Lyme or resulted from your Lyme?  What medications have worked for you?  What medications have been problematic?   <br/>  <br/> My symptoms are that I have: inattention to detail  constantly make careless mistakes resulting in poor reviews in job performance--no matter how hard I try to concentrate to avoid mistakes  I am constantly switching up what I am doing--can't just sit down and write a long paper for work  I can't read anything for work straight through  I have to stop and read my email every few minutes  or chew gum or play bejeweled blitz(   ) every minute or so  making me very inefficient and making me lose my train of thought  can't sit through the news  even things I love I leave incomplete  etc.   <br/>  <br/> I would be ETERNALLY grateful for any help/wisdom!!!!,3,38,0.021978022,Training,Training

I've been feeling ill for some time now  with lots of weird symptoms and health issues. I saw an ILADS doctor several weeks ago  who is pretty sure I have Lyme  but I'd like to be certain. <br/>  <br/> He started me on doxycline  200mg/daily  and I've been feeling extra tired  a bit sickly (like getting the flu)  occasional bouts of hypotension and dizziness  and sometimes get a weird 'muscle vibration'  for lack of a better term. Are these all herx symptoms? How long do they typically last? <br/>  <br/> My preliminary testing didn't show Lyme  but it did show exposure to ticks. Western Blot through local lab didn't return any positive bands  but my doctor said that wasn't unusual. Approx 10 years ago I had an iffy Western Blot  with several bands  but not enough to be considered Lyme positive  so I was never treated. <br/>  <br/> I am scheduled for an Igenex WB soon. I expect the Doxy will increase its sensitivity somewhat? <br/>  <br/> What did turn up from the testing was positive past exposure to: <br/>  <br/> Ehrilica HME (1:128)  Spotted Fever (1:128)  Typhus (1:128) and a high EBV-VCA IGG. <br/>  <br/> He said I should go on Doxy just because of the Ehlircia alone  but what do the other results mean exactly? Spotted fever implies more tick exposure  I guess  but Typhus? And EBV simply means past exposure to mono?  <br/>  <br/> Any help appreciated. Thanks.,3,14,0.062992126,Training,Training

I was wandering could it have been <br/>  <br/> possible I had burnt my skin due I put bleach on <br/>  <br/> the spot since I thought it was ringworm. (bleach  <br/>  <br/> is an old household remedy for ring worm).   <br/>  <br/> I had small spot that looked just like ringworm  to me <br/>  <br/> and it had no red around it all until I put bleach <br/>  <br/> on it. What is your opinion here????? <br/>  <br/> I think I am getting worried since my Lupus number <br/>  <br/> were up way and I am <br/>  <br/> experiencing some pretty good back pain where my <br/>  <br/> kidney is located. I think I have got to go to <br/>  <br/> hospital to get checked the pain is more severe <br/>  <br/> each day and I am unable to stand more than 5 <br/>  <br/> minutes sometimes less without feeling I am ready <br/>  <br/> to pass out.. Its pretty bad. I need to check this <br/>  <br/> out my urine smells different as well and I had a <br/>  <br/> swollen left foot. <br/> I actually did not experience any joint pain with <br/>  <br/> with this (lymes)  and I pray I dont.. My main problem is I <br/>  <br/> cannot stand I am dizzy all the time and feel like <br/>  <br/> I am going to pass out. I was hoping the <br/>  <br/> antibiotics would relive this however they have <br/>  <br/> not so far and I am afraid if If I dont get checked <br/>  <br/> my kidneys are being damaged. I am almost afraid <br/>  <br/> I could have lupus since this is a symptom of <br/>  <br/> lupus more so than Lymes. What do u think????? I <br/>  <br/> cannot wait to see a Lymes doc and get some <br/>  <br/> answers. I need a real lymes test too. I ve had 3 <br/>  <br/> test and 2 were negative which is usually the case <br/>  <br/> I hear. I have not got results from the last one <br/>  <br/> yet.

I first felt the aches on Labor Day weekend and by that night was on the couch is pretty bad shape. I spent a little over a week with the horrendous symptoms  thinking I had the flu  until I called my doc and he told me to come in.  He found the bite/rash between my shoulder blades.  I was put on the meds that day  and took them for 3 weeks. I also had the rash elsewhere on my body  but not severely.  I felt better after the meds  but still feel like I have a couple of symptoms. <br/>  <br/> - I am tired a lot.  I've always been a high-energy person  the kind who gets up at 5am without an alarm going off  and is on the move all day until 10pm.  Since the Lyme though I feel like I could sleep 12 hours a night or more. I got to bed around 9 and have to drag out around 5:15.   I can make it through my day OK  but honestly feel like I could sleep for hours at any point! Could this be a lasting impact of the Lyme  even though I seem to be cured? <br/>  <br/> - the second question is does Lyme ever cause lasting localized aches?  My hands are really sore  which I think has more to do with too much time on the computer -     -  but I thought I'd mention it. <br/>  <br/> TIA! <br/>  <br/> Terri,10,19,0.044280443,Training,Training

2156.492445,yes,yes,1439,68696,1,0,0,0,Let me first start by giving y'all a quick synopsis of my illness. I've been ill for the past three years without a diagnosis. After a sickening amount of ED visits  wrong diagnosis' & worsening symptoms - I was diagnosed with third-stage Lyme in the beginning of last month.  <br/>  <br/> The MD has started treatment with oral antibiotics immediatley. I started with two on very high doses - a week after beginning them I had an anaphylatic reaction. I've been on four or five (can't remember) oral antibiotics  however i've been in the ED with every antibiotic due to allergic reactions. I am highly allergic (after being tested at two allergist/immunologist) to most antibiotics. I've become so ill that I now am pretty much bed-ridden. The pain medication helps somewhat but nothing makes my pain good enough for full-functioning. I take numerous vitamins/supplements.  <br/>  <br/> My MD is now in search of an ICU that will admitt me. In addition  I now have Bronchitis. I need to be admitted in the ICU for IV antibiotics due to serious risks of an allergic reaction.  <br/>  <br/> I lay here in bed  with no ability to functioning. Day by day things are getting worse - & my severe allergies are not helping. <br/>  <br/> I forgot my point in writing this (as my cognitive abilities are shot)... but I do wonder - has anyone suffered numerous allergic reactions? does anyone have severe antibiotic allergies? .... <br/>  <br/>    ,2,21,0.040650407,Training,Training

Has any one else had this particular eye problem? <br/>  <br/> I also wanted to thank anyone who sent me info on finding a physician - I was so sick (and mentally foggy) at the time I never responded directly.   <br/>  <br/> Thanks  <br/> Elliep.,18,19,0.045081967,Training,Training

When I finished the therapy  about a couple of weeks later I relapsed. I went to the free clinic I go to since I have no health insurance and no dime  and I was told there that it is normal for these relapses  and that there is absolutely no need for more antibiotics as they are useless. the bacteria  they said  has been killed. The relapse did not last long  I recovered within a couple of days. Since then I went a couple of times through a terrible back pain (I could hardly expand my lungs breathing) that I attribute to the lyme.

I have both babs microti and duncani. <br/>  <br/> I think I'm on relapse #4  now.  It's possible that this is #5.  Yikes. <br/>  <br/> My history as best I can remember (posting thanks to groovy's suggestion): <br/>  <br/> Treated 8 mos the first time - used Mepron  Biaxin and doxy (I think) for 4 mos  then switched to Mepron  Ketek  and another abx (can't remember which) for 4 mos. <br/>  <br/> Relapsed after 4 mos (in the interim was on IV Roceph)  and then treated for another 6 mos on Mepron  Zith  and Omnicef. <br/>  <br/> Another relapse within 4 mos  while treating Lyme and other co's. <br/>  <br/> Third time  treated 4 mos with Malarone  zith and another abx (again  can't remember the 3rd  sorry). <br/>  <br/> After the next relapse  treated with Mepron  zith  plaquenil for several months. <br/>  <br/> In the meantime  between these episodes  I have continued treatment for Lyme  Bart and other co's  using various combos - Bactrim is one that may have had an effect on Babs  too  I think. <br/>  <br/> Have not been able to tolerate artemisinin  so have not used it for any length of time. <br/>  <br/> I am in the midst of another babs relapse  and back on Mepron  Biaxin and Omnicef. <br/>  <br/> After a short Biaxin herx  I started the Mepron and just felt better and better for 10 days.   <br/>  <br/> Now the herx has started  but I've never had a delayed babs herx like this before. <br/>  <br/> I really want to kick babs  and am starting to think that there may be a better combo of meds to try - since it feels like I'm spinning my wheels with the Mepron combos. <br/>  <br/> Can you offer any suggestions  or some hope?? <br/>  <br/> Would love to hear from someone who's experienced these multiple relapses and finally kicked it - even anecdotal stories would be welcome. <br/>  <br/> Editing to add that we believe I was initially infected 20+ years before being diagnosed.,21,9,0.096256684,Training,Training

2268.859822,yes,yes,3652,63688,2,0,0,0,Hello  everyone.  <br/>  <br/> It wasn't my intention to ever post on a Lyme Disease site until I made a few comparisons with a friend who has it and the desperation to find a DX. I'll TRY to keep this as simple as possible. <br/>  <br/> It started with my left eye  almost exactly a year ago. I had been exercising  took a break and it looked like someone put a piece of wax paper over my eye for about 3 minutes. I  also  got very dizzy. Talk about freaky  eh?  <br/>  <br/> A couple weeks later  I pass out in my car for an hour while smoking a cig just to wake up choking on my own spit  cig still in hand and enduring a massive tremor in my left arm. I call the doc  they call the ambulance. <br/>  <br/>  Must be anxiety   they said.  <br/>  <br/> All the Cat scans and blood work were normal. Fantastic! A mystery! Where's Scooby Doo when you need him? <br/>  <br/> I talked to my sis about it  remembering  also  that my left arm had been acting funny. I couldn't drive with it  anymore  or talk on a cell phone. It was practically useless  feeling numb  fatigued  plagued with pins and needles or just in pain. She screams out  MS!  I was insulted... I thought she was messing with me until she couldn't stop crying 'til the next day. So I did my research and it got me thinking. Hmm...a lot of the things on that list sound pretty familiar... <br/>  <br/> Here are my symptoms to the current date: <br/>  <br/> Summer of 2007 - Bottom half of my face (about up to the bridge of my nose) goes completely numb. I start shaking like a maniac. This lasts for a good 2-3 hours. Could barely walk upon getting out of the car. <br/>  <br/> Slamming into doorways when trying to walk through them. <br/>  <br/> Slamming into desks  tables  etc... when trying to walk by them.  <br/>  <br/> Horrible depth perception with my ears (i.e. hearing things behind me when they're in front of me). <br/>  <br/> Tired all the time.  <br/>  <br/> Random anxiety attacks all day  everyday. <br/>  <br/> Loss of bladder/bowel control or the urge to go  frequently  for no good reason. <br/>  <br/> Random  sunburn  pain and/or itchiness on areas on my body. <br/>  <br/> Whole left side of body was numb  fatigued and/or feeling pins and needles  at some point.  <br/>  <br/> The worst pain I've ever felt in both my legs for about 2 days. NOTHING helped. <br/>  <br/> Black or white  swarms  of glowing spots. <br/>  <br/> Loss of taste in my mouth or poison taste in my mouth. <br/>  <br/> Shaking...my whole body...or tremors in my limbs. <br/>  <br/> Loss of balance. <br/>  <br/> Forgetting things (how to spell  that I'm carrying things  how to get back to my house  etc...). <br/>  <br/> Headaches/migraines I've had for years. <br/>  <br/> Partial/total loss of vision on several occasions. <br/>  <br/>  Lightning bolt  pains up and down my spine. <br/>  <br/> Well....the list goes on and on. I suppose I'll list my tests and results and get on with the posting. <br/>  <br/> MRI - positive with white matter.  <br/> EEG - abnormal. <br/> EKG - normal. <br/> Optic Neuritis Test - normal. <br/> Sleep Study - said to have Idiocratic Hypersomnia. <br/> Blood work - negative for Lyme  diabetes or anything else they may have been looking for. My doctor said I was healthier than a lot of people. <br/>  <br/> My primary physician points out that MS can't be ruled out  just yet. My neurologist says she can't think of any more tests she can give me and shoved me off to get a second opinion.  <br/>  <br/> I'm now waiting to get an appointment with a new doctor. <br/>  <br/> I'm angry  I want a diagnosis and I want to be fixed. <br/>  <br/> Help!     ,12,8,0.10075188,Training,Training

2287.22767,yes,yes,4037,19854,2,0,0,0,I have a sneaking suspicion that I might have Lyme Disease  but after being blown off by my doctor yesterday I'm not sure what  if anything  I should do.  This might get long winded  please bear with me... <br/>  <br/> Back in Aug/Sept 2002 I was doing some field work at an Army post in Kentucky which was heavily infested with ticks.  Despite taking every precaution  I know I was bitten at least 2 or 3 times  including one on my scalp that was quite engorged by the time I found it.  I did not notice any rash (although did not have anyone check in my hair) and I do not recall being sick around then.  However  that was a long time ago so I may have just forgotten.  Since then I've had the usual seasonal colds and one nasty flu that went around my office in 2004.  I do sometimes get that icky  I'm coming down with somehting  feeling and nothing follows  but never thought anything of it.  In spring of 2006 I was diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis.  Last fall I began to get frequent headaches and noticed 2 lumps  one in my neck to the right of my spine and one above that on the base of my skull.  Both cause me pain.  Went to the doc and was diagnosed with migraines (although these don't feel like the migraines I used to get from 1996-2001)  doc said she did not feel any lumps and prescribed Imitrex.  Then late this winter I had headaches ( migraine  or no) everyday for at least a month.  Went back to the doc and was put on a beta blocker to prevent migraines.  The beta blocker made me a total space case  so I cut the dose in half.  I was still having spells of dizziness and lightheadedness - thought I was going to pass out several times while driving  very scary!!  These were accompanied by a feeling that I needed to take very deep breaths and even then was not getting enough oxygen to my brain.  I quit taking the beta blocker altogether  and while it is better I am still having the lightheaded feeling on occasion. Then about 4 weeks ago I noticed my neck was stiff and painful.  I became fatigued to the point that taking a shower or washing my face is a major task.  Also  my dentist pointed out that my throat was extremely red although it did not hurt (since then have had some slight soreness)  and I have had a low grade fever off and on. The neck pain was constant and did not go away for weeks (not to mention the pain in my  lumps  is still there)  so I made a dr. appt. but could not get in for a while.  In the meantime I did some research on what could be causing the neck issue  and one of the things that came up was Lyme.  I noticed some symptoms of chronic Lyme that were eerily familiar to me - things that I have noticed for the past couple of years but chalked up to my imaginiation or side effects of medication (I am also on various things for anxiety and depression  have been since 1998).  This includes ringing in my ears  losing feeling/circulation in fingers and toes  no libido  ever increasing number of annoying floaters in my eyes  unexplained nausea  increasing fogetfulness and slight confusion (have a hard time thinking of the right words when speaking  and I have a great vocabulary!)  and problems with balance and coordination (stumble a lot  walk into door frames and corners  drop things ofen - feel like my fingers won't  work with me ).  Finally got to see the doctor yesterday  and when I mentioned Lyme she actually laughed at me.  She said that I didn't have a high enough fever and that it had been too long since exposure.  She asked if I had gotten it in 2002 then why did I just now get a stiff neck.  I had to say I don't know  but that I was pretty sure it could happen.  No use.  She gave me some muscle relaxers and ear drops (one was red when she looked in it) and sent me on my way.  So... <br/>  <br/> Am I totally crazy to think I could have Lyme disease?  Or does anyone think it could be a real possiblity?  And if so  anyone know a doctor in the Cincinnati area who would at least take me seriously?

My wife has been dealing with a myriad of strange symptoms for the last year and is at her wits end. We live in SF  CA. About a year ago she woke up with terrible vertigo that kept her in bed for the day. It has never gone away. It peaks and valleys. In addtion she's had a list of other things including joint pain in her knee  numbness in her pinky that hasn't gone away  shooting pains in her leg  back pain. The other night her jaw was hurting then went away 12 hours later. She's always tired. She feels like she has a bladder infection  has been treated for it  yet it never really goes away. <br/>  <br/> Recently a Lyme specialist diagnosed her with Lyme and Babezia. We got a second opinion which subsequently  un-diagnosed  her. The second opinion Dr. is telling us that the lab used by the first Dr  is  famous  for always finding positive lyme results and he is skeptical. His lab performed the same tests  with all coming back negative for Lyme and Babezia. He is strongly urging us to NOT go forward with Lyme treatment  yet does not have an explanation for my wife's symptoms. She's been tested for just about every life-threatening illness(Hotchkins  MS  Cancer  you name it)all test have come back negative. <br/>  <br/> However her symptoms seem to match Lyme and her story is very similar to the ones I've read on this community. We are very confused and do not know where to go next. We don't know who to believe. I am wondering if anyone has a similar story and could direct my wife and I to another resource. She is growing depressed as time goes on. We are both 39 and have two children and just want to get our life back. <br/>  <br/> Thank you.,11,45,0.018518519,Training,Training

I finally went to the doctor and he gave me some amoxicillen for a sinus infection.  I took it for four days and then broke out in some pretty intense hives.  The doctor then put me on Claritin and Zyrtec twice a day.  That didn't help so then I took five days worth of Prednisone.  The hives went down after that.  My skin is still really sensitive though.  The day I finished my steroids I started getting joint pain.  It migrates from joint to joint and some times its debilitating.  It was in my wrists and shoulders and now its in my hips.  The doctor said that he thinks its just an allergic reaction to amox or a weird virus.  When I mentioned lyme disease he said that it was unlikely because its too early in the year.  But he did say that if half my face become paralyzed I need to get treated for lyme disease.  Do I have lyme disease anyone think?  I haven't been really tired or anything.

If so has he published it anywhere? <br/>  <br/> Q3: What is his relationship with Klinghardt? <br/>  <br/> Q4: Does he certify patients as Lyme-cured by ART? <br/>  <br/> Q5: Can ART be used on animals? If so it would seem to be easy to establish whether it works or not: Infect half of a cohort of dogs with a disease (say Lyme) and then see if an ART practitioner could successfully select the infected dogs and tell what their infection was. If ART requires a verbal response from the patient this obviously won't work  but I thought is involved only some sort of meter that hooked up to the subject. <br/>  <br/> Q6: Same as Q4 and Q5 except substitute biotensor dowsing rod for ART. <br/>  <br/> Thank you. <br/> asherms1 <br/>   <br/> Posts: 1 <br/> Joined: Tue 23 Dec 2008 18:45,7,11,0.074418605,Training,Training

2389.982264,yes,yes,2617,82362,8,0,0,0,Hey all  <br/>  <br/> I've got a large number of symptoms that correlate to Lyme Disease  in conjunction with a very large history of exposure to ticks in the two most Lyme prevalent states in the Midwest. <br/>  <br/> At any rate  I'm at the point now where I'll be getting bloodwork done for testing for Lyme tomorrow  as well as getting an MRI  but today I'm in one hell of state where I'm concerned about working tomorrow (but have already take an few days worth of time off this past week or two) and I'm concerned about sleeping tonight. <br/>  <br/> Basically  my condition has worsened to the point where when I sit still or lie down for even 5 minutes  I often loose sense and function of 1 or more limbs. <br/>  <br/> This temporary partial paralysis started 3 or 4 nights ago with 1 paralyzed leg (left)  and only occurred once.   Today  not even a week later  I've had this occur on up to 3 limbs (two left  plus right leg)  plus the torso. <br/>  <br/> So  basically I was fixed in my chair (where I was when it started) with my hand still holding the the bottle of Gatorade I had physically removed from it with my right hand about 1 hour previous. <br/>  <br/> To top this off  I'm getting major muscle spasms  all over  but largely concentrated to the mid-section.   <br/>  <br/> Even better  I'm getting phantom taste in my mouth every ~30 seconds that tastes somewhere between grape and deviled eggs. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I'm right now reaching my threshold as to how much I can take.   I don't know if I can honestly handle another night and day of this madness  only to go through 3-4 hours of testing and wait another 2-3 days for results. <br/>  <br/> I mean  if it's progressing this rate  will I be able to move anything at any time by the time they get the results back?   And what about treatment  how long before this madness comes to a complete end  or at least a turning point? <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I was seriously at the point of wishing my wife would just take me to the ER and demand I be hospitalized and treated for whatever it is NOW. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I need advise from you guys right now  what should I do at this juncture?  <br/>  <br/> Should I just  tough it out  a few more days till I get results back? <br/> Should I rush to the ER? <br/> Other? <br/>  <br/> Granted  mobility has spontaneously returned for the short-term  but I know when I lie down tonight I will once again loose mobility  and I wouldn't be surprised if I loose all 4 limbs and my torso.

The patients I have seen who test positive for Bartonella do not have psychiatric symptoms different from pure culture Lyme patients.  <br/>  <br/> Bartonella is intracellular and infects red blood cells. Please show me medical literature that demonstrates its ability to cross the blood brain barrier and cause persistent brain infection.In my experience  these patients do even better with IV Rocephin.  <br/>  <br/> Frankly  I keep seeing patients who have not improved after months of Bart therapy from other physicians. They respond amazingly well to Rocephin. Bartonella is susceptible to multiple antibiotics including Zithromax and Doxycycline.

Not sure of those results. <br/>  <br/> Mine came back a simple 45  with indicators &lt; lower or &gt; greater than the normal range of 60 - 300.  <br/>  <br/> It is recommended only labcorp for cd 57 as they invented the test and are most knowledgeable about the testing procedures. <br/>  <br/> Blood should ALWAYS be drawn early in the week and not left to sit around. <br/>  <br/> CD57 measures the number of NK killer cells that can ONLY affected by lyme. That is why there was excitement when this test first came out.  <br/>  <br/>  http://www.anapsid.org/lyme/strickerpanel.html  <br/>  <br/> From what I understand  the bad side to this test is they cant figure out why some folks are seriously ill with normal counts  feel good with low counts  and that it cant really be a measure of whether you are improving. <br/>  <br/> My LLMD said it measures how much your immune system has been impacted and if the number is LOW then you should be taking lots of immune supplements to help get it back to full speed. <br/>  <br/> Some doctors feel that if the patient is very sick and their count is in the normal range then coinfections could very well be a factor.

2513.543372,yes,yes,1652,58028,4,0,0,0,Hey Everyone  <br/>  <br/> Please take time to read this and respond to my questions.  I am very sick  and I'm in Georgia. <br/>  <br/> No one knows anything here! <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I have had symptoms of Lyme Disease for about a little over a year and I made the doctor test me for Lyme. my Lyme came up positive and my western blot did as well.  What you should know is that I reside in Savannah  GA where no one knows about Lyme Disease  actually it took them this long to treat me.  (I assume I got infected in Rhode Island  NJ  or NC where I was hiking.)  I had gotten bit multiple times and did have a rash  but thought if it was Lyme it would be more prominent.  I had all the symptoms except for facial paralysis. <br/>  <br/> Now   I am seeing an infectious disease doctor. I practically made him put me on antibiotics. (I was also one of his first cases of Lyme) I was on treatment for a month and a half and my doctor took me off saying that everything is gone  (he didn't test me again)   <br/>  <br/> I know I need to stay on these longer  because I eventually started to feel better on the last days of my medicine.  My symptoms are all all gradually creeping up on me again. <br/>  <br/> I am only 22 and I feel like I'm going to die. <br/>  <br/> My question for everyone is: <br/>  <br/> How long were you on doxycycline for? <br/>  <br/> Are inter venous drugs worth it? <br/>  <br/> Would most doctors argue that you should be on Antibiotics longer than 1-2 months? <br/>  <br/> If I need to be on longer what arguments should I give to the idiot.  <br/>  <br/> Thank You <br/>  <br/> I appreciate anything you could answer for me.,12,10,0.085443038,Training,Training

2547.513335,yes,yes,1544,40428,271,2,0,1,Headaches in the back of the head are usually not typical of migraines. Sounds more like some sort of inflammation in the neck or the muscles of the scalp. Could also be from food allergies  believe it or not. <br/>  <br/> Is epedrin similar to Midrin? Funny way to start off w/migraine meds anyway. <br/>  <br/> Muscle relaxants will help you diagnose  anyway  because if the pain is better  you can assume that it is  in fact  from muscle spasms or inflammation. <br/>  <br/> There are creams you can use  if you want to avoid meds  and also the Ben Gay type of thing. Have you tried that? Or compresses? <br/>  <br/> No matter what med you take  or what you take it for  please know that for some of us  taking like 1/4- 1/10 of the expected lowest dose is often the best way to start. Then ramp up until the med is effective  but before side effects are bad. <br/>  <br/> In our family  we have managed to get some good results from some drugs that we had previously rejected as totally impossible because of side effects even at 1/2 the  usual starting dose.  <br/>  <br/> If you start very low and very slow  you don't have to be afraid of meds as much. <br/>  <br/> But I still wonder why the epedrin-? <br/>  <br/> Have you tried tylenol/codeine at all? If you really are having migraines  caffeine can help too. <br/>  <br/> Good luck. I am not even getting into the need to see an LLMD  and the lack of knowledge among specialists like neurologists.

2560.079138,yes,yes,1993,57743,3,0,0,0,My 77 year old mother had a tick attached to the back of her ear for a week.  During that week she began having a very stiff neck.  That is the only symptom she has had  but it is severe and has lasted almost a month now.  She cannot move her head and walks all bent over.  Before this tick bite she has had uncontrollable diarehea for six months and was diangosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome and began taking lotronex.  She lives on a farm with a wooded area and she routinely picks ticks off of her outdoor cat when he comes in.  This is the first time she has been aware of a tick biting her.  My father is a deer hunter and says he has had many tick bites over the years  but never had any symptoms.  They live in Pensacola in Northwest Florida and Lyme's Disease is not a huge problem there.  She keeps thinking that her stiff neck will get better  but it has not. <br/>  <br/> She finally went to see her arthritis doctor today and he agreed her neck is very stiff. She has arthritis in her spine but never before in her neck. He gave her two injections at the pressure points  plus a prescription for Methylprednisolone dospak (a steroid) and a muscle relaxer called skelaxin.  After the injections he did some sort of blood tests for lyme disease and CBC plus xrays for her neck.  He told her to use moise heat and come back in a week and if she is not better  then he will send her to an infectious disease doctor.  Her diarhea has returned and her gastro-intestinal doctor has told her to increase her lotronex.  She felt a little relief tonight. <br/>  <br/> Is there anything more or different that she might do at this point?  Should she be starting to take an antibiotic as a precaution or wait until the tests come back and then go to a different doctor?  How long is it safe to wait to begin the antibiotic treatment  if she does have Lyme's Disease? <br/>  <br/> Thank you for any tips you might give based on your experiences.

2593.120094,yes,yes,3246,87351,3,0,0,0,Hi Everyone. <br/> I am so happy I found this forum - a friend of mine with LD (who swears that has to be what I have) told me to look on the Internet so I could get some validation of my  self diagnosis  and here it is! <br/>  <br/> This is going to be kind of long  but thought I'd share my story to date: <br/>  <br/> In September last year  I was at a family gathering and my left hand started to swell up - big time  scary swelling where we thought we would have to cut off a ring.  <br/>  <br/> Since we had been outside  I assumed I had been bitten by a spider or something. After that  though  life seemed to change quickly. <br/>  <br/> Within two weeks  I had  wandering  swelling  hands  wrists  knees  lips  bottom of my feet.....  <br/> Hives: some contact hives from clothes on my belly  back of my neck  hands.....  <br/> Edemas: big hard lumps behind my knees  inside of my elbows  bottom of my feet  either side of my spine at the top of my shoulders.... on my neck <br/>  <br/> I saw my PCP  she was concerned  gave me an epipen and sent me to an allergist. The allergist did a gazillion allergy tests  NOTHING. <br/>  <br/> He tested me twice for heriditary angioedema (first inconclusive  second negative) and LD (because I asked him to - I had realized  finally  that I had been camping in Wisconsin three weeks before this started).  <br/>  <br/> The LD was negative. The last time I saw him  though  I told him about the tingling in my back that started in December and the  staring  spells that were starting to freak me out - I am forgetting words  and did it in front of a client  it was bad. <br/>  <br/> Once while driving  I knew I had to turn right  but kept turning left - not dangerous  but just like I couldn't make myself go where I wanted to. <br/> He sent me to a neurologist  who is also tenacious.  <br/>  <br/> He sent me for an MRI and an EEG to rule out other things  but said right away the lyme titer may have been a false negative. My doctors are all talking to each other  but nothing is moving fast enough for me at this point. <br/>  <br/> The allergist put me on 14 days of prednisone - I was in heaven  no hives or swelling for 18 days. Then it hit me like never before.  <br/>  <br/> The tingling and swelling in my back and joints are now constantly painful  nothing relieves it  including Tylenol 3. the fatigue is relentless. I can get going in the morning  but by noon  just want to sit and stare.  <br/>  <br/> I got some pm's here and found an LLMD (or DO) only 8 miles from me. I called the office and they took my information and said they would send me an intake packet and then schedule an appoointment - is that typical? <br/>  <br/> My boyfriend and I are taking his 8 year old son to Disneyworld for the first time at the end of the month and I am terrified that I'll ruin the trip by not wanting to do anything.  <br/>  <br/> Any advice on what stops the pain for any of you  at least temporarily?  <br/>  <br/> Anyway  sorry if this is long  but I'm so happy to find people who seem to have the same issues I do and have had them for a long time... makes me realize I'm not crazy  I think. <br/> Thanks! <br/> H <br/>   <br/>   [ 03-08-2009  01:27 PM: Message edited by: heather ] ,16,15,0.060897436,Training,Training

2625.511319,yes,yes,2410,48301,2,0,0,0,I'm just starting to investigate this whole Lyme thing... <br/>  <br/> In 1997  I found a tick embedded in me a day or two after camping in a wooded area in Central California.   <br/>  <br/> I had the bull's eye rash and had been feeing awful- like a truck hit me.   <br/>  <br/> I was never given a blood test for Lyme  but I was treated for it with meds.  I responded positively to the treatment so that was that.   <br/>  <br/> This past September  I discovered enlarged lymph nodes in my armpit  and then enlarged nodes in my groin in November.   <br/>  <br/> I had been suffering from fatigue and an excessive amount of colds and flus.    <br/>  <br/> ANA blood tests came back positive twice  but nothing else was abnormal.   <br/>  <br/> Lyme  teitur?   came back negative <br/>  <br/> I was treated  with a round of Levaquin.   <br/>  <br/> Finally last month I had the nodes in my arm biopsied.  The official result was a  benign reactive lymph node.    <br/>  <br/> The nodes in my groin are still enlarged. <br/>  <br/> Looking back now  I see that my health really started to change around the time I got bit by that tick.   <br/>  <br/> I seem to get fatigued more easily than others  especially if I've been in the sun.   <br/>  <br/> I also had heart palpitation problems around the year 2000. <br/>  <br/>   I had an atrial ablation which took care of the it  and i haven't had any trouble with that since.  <br/>  <br/> I have been getting colds at the rate of one a month for the past few months  and my fatigue seems to be getting worse.   <br/>  <br/> I have no aches or pains   <br/>  <br/> no symptoms of the  mental fog   <br/>  <br/> I have tinnitus and have had that for years.   <br/>  <br/> My doctors seem to have written off Lyme since the original test came back negative.  <br/>  <br/>  I'm now being referred to a rheumatologist  and my primary physician told me this may be something I'll just  have to learn to live with.    <br/>  <br/> It's not yet to the point where it's affecting my work  but I have had to turn down social events because I'm tired or am suffering from yet another cold.  <br/>  <br/> Thyroid checked numerous times and it is normal.   <br/>  <br/> I've also tested negative for mono  had normal CBC  sed rate  and TSH results.   <br/>  <br/> Any ideas on where to go from here? <br/>   <br/>   [ 03-29-2009  03:49 PM: Message edited by: urbancalgirl ] ,8,7,0.115473441,Training,Training

They are a type of pain specialist that really seem to understand the whole body. <br/>  <br/> Treating pain correctly should be a combined approach.  They should work to find medication that generally reduces the pain  and then have a break through med for when the pain still comes through.  Often  things like physical therapy or acupuncture can also help. <br/>  <br/> It might take a few visits to find the right specialist.  But it's worth looking if you are able to. <br/>  <br/> I have really bad muscle pain.  I recently started Zanaflex and I went from taking 3 vicodin a day to taking 1-2 a week.   <br/>  <br/> I also started working with a psychologist who specializes in pain coping techniques.  I was dubious at first  but after 2 visits I'm amazed how the mind can actually reduce the pain you feel.  He basically teaches meditation techniques that help you stop focusing on the pain.   <br/>  <br/> One technique is so powerful  he made me promise to never use it on new pain I haven't spoken to a doctor about.

I know it is spelled funny. <br/>  <br/> __________________________________________________________________ <br/>  <br/> After reading a lot of info on Lime disease I then called my Aunt where I spent every summer in Indiana for years growing up.  <br/>  <br/> My cousin who grew up there was diagnosed with MS.  <br/>  <br/> So I wondered if I maybe had a tick found on me or a fever any of those summers.  <br/>  <br/> She told me there was one summer I complained of my legs aching and headaches but no fever.  <br/>  <br/> She just told me it was growing pains. <br/>  <br/> I told her last night about the anecdotal evidence of MS being misdiagnosed and is often LD. <br/>  <br/> She told me that 3 other people in a 5 mile area are also diagnosed with MS over the last years that grew up with my cousin and went to school with each other. <br/>  <br/> Also a man sometime over the years was diagnosed with LD about 10 miles away from her house. <br/>  <br/> ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I also read a lot of info on symptoms and watched many YouTube videos.  <br/>  <br/> Some Symptoms were mentioned that I never even thought were actually symptoms.  <br/>  <br/> I think if ADHD was known about when I was young  I would have certainly been diagnosed with it. <br/>  <br/> I think I still have it. <br/>  <br/> At 20 Yrs old my neck started hurting and Drs couldn?t find a cause.  <br/>  <br/> I went home with no help and accused of drug seeking.  <br/>  <br/> Again I never went to another doctor for 15 more years for my neck pain. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> About 10 years ago I went to a Dr about how my stamina was gone. <br/>  <br/> I felt like falling asleep during the day a lot. <br/>  <br/> He tried to give me Prozac and said it was depression.  <br/>  <br/> I disagreed and left with no help and never spoke of it again for years  just living with it.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The pain started spreading down my spine and so I went to a reumatologist.  <br/>  <br/> He started giving me steroid shots and they helped  I thought. <br/>  <br/> I told him about the daytime sleepiness and he sent me to a sleep study.  <br/>  <br/> I was diagnosed with a sleep disorder  which is still not under control. <br/>  <br/> It seems like half the meds he tries on me I have weird reactions to them. <br/>  <br/> I can't even take any antidepressants because of this problem. <br/>  <br/> ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ <br/>  <br/>  <br/> 4 years ago I suddenly got hit with unbearable burning nerve pain and joint pain from my waist down.  <br/>  <br/> 2 of those years nobody including my family believed me. <br/>  <br/> I have been in and out of wheelchairs 5 times in the last 4 years. <br/>  <br/> I had mutilating surgeries on my hips that didn't help at all with my pain. <br/>  <br/> I had spinal blocks  which made me worse.  <br/>  <br/> It was so bad after the last try I screamed in pain for over a month. <br/>  <br/> And he stopped even trying to help with the additional pain he caused.  <br/>  <br/> No oral meds because I could be drug seeking and he would not give me oral meds at all for any reason. <br/>  <br/> That doctor told my husband to admit me to the psychological ward.  <br/>  <br/> He also lied in his records  saying I was getting better. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I had a spinal cord implant last May and it helped the nerve pain probably enough to keep me from shooting myself in the head. <br/>  <br/> But I have arthritis type pain in my joints that keeps me in bed 60 - 80% of the day. <br/>  <br/> One big reason is because I can not sit for more than an hour or two and walking is very painful. <br/>  <br/> I lost a great job and am now completely disabled but with private disability.  <br/>  <br/> The problem with that is I can?t get insurance  even Medicare or Medicaid. (I get them confused every time sorry). <br/>  <br/> _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ <br/>  <br/>  <br/> We are trying and sell our dream home for 2 reasons. <br/>  <br/> One is to have money for medical expenses.  <br/>  <br/> Two is because we live out in the country and I can't drive into town without paying for it with days of  pain. <br/>  <br/> Anyway I was just wondering if this sounds as classic to you as it does to me? After I read the information I have been advised to read all I can think of is this sounds classic. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> One thing though that I can not find even googling is: When my Dr put the implant into my spinal cord he told us that my ligaments between my vertebrae are the strangest texture he has ever felt.  <br/>  <br/> They are - in my words mushy. And he had no idea what it could be. <br/>  <br/> Also my spine is so narrow he could only fit one leed (small wire). Normally they use 2 just in case one fails. Yet my xrays and MRIs don't show stenosis. Can that be swelling? <br/>  <br/>  <br/> My pain has been from my waist down for the last 4 years and I have been diagnosed with  Targeted Fibromyalgia (No Such Thing  Lazy Drs) to Depression to I don?t have any idea to your just crazy . <br/>  <br/> Recently I have been getting shoulder pain and my hands feel swollen and sore at the joints after sleeping. <br/>  <br/> So now it is spreading even more. This will just make my Dr probably say - see I told you it was Fibro.   <br/>  <br/> I hope it was ok to write this post this long. Sorry if too long. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Thanks  <br/> Conny <br/>    ,10,7,0.120952381,Training,Training

She said she feels that's how she got it. I have had Lyme for 10 years and was treated by a LLMD for 3 years and have never been told by him it was possible or seen ANY indication in all the literature that Lyme can be transmitted by sperm or would have taken precautions (she is past menapause). I don't remember the article or publication that said it but does anyone else think that it is possible or have they seen any publications or research that shows it's possible? Her boys are mad at me thinking I gave it to her and she has decided she got it this way even though we were in PA for months working in the gardens and in a Lyme infested area of eastern Pa at our old place and thats where I got Lyme. I would like to clear this up because I've never heard that Lyme could be transferred this way in all the three years of research I've done. Can anyone help clear this up?

He started having severe eye pain and headaches to the point that he had to take a leave of absense from his job.  He works on a computer all day long and found that he just could not function anymore....he also cant drive  exercise  read or watch TV for long periods as his eyes are very painful.....He is also very sensitive to light and his eyes are very dry.  He has seen so many eye specialists at Wills Eye Hospital who can not find anything wrong.  Well last month the pain got so bad that he went to Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia and spent a week getting treatment for his eye and head pain....again he saw several neurologists and headache specialists and he is now on medications for Migraines but he has had no relief....now here is where the Lymes question comes up..........While in the hospital he was tested for Lymes........the Elisa came up positive.....the Western Blot was negative....they did a PCR which was negative and then a spinal tap again the CSf was negative.  Does this mean Lymes is completely ruled out?????   I may be barking up the wrong tree but I want to leave no stone unturned.....Oh yes and he just got results back from a rheumotologist and the blood work was all negative.....and also his white blood cells are normal too.

I have been found to have genetic glitches that make it hard to detox neurotoxins.  Not the worst it can be  but problems nonetheless.   <br/>  <br/> And  you may be right  with antifungals  I may be able to tolerate the abx better than I think.  I don't seem to have a big Candida problem at the moment (I dealt with that  too  a long time ago).  I am just susceptible to it again.   <br/>  <br/> TerryK  how much better are you after 3 years?

My head is spinning from all the things I have read and I am very confused.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> An internal Med Doc is the one who finally diagnosed me. She has me on doxycycline (200 mg) for 6 weeks. After 7 days I already have a vaginal yeast infection even though I dramatically changed my diet ie: no sugar  very few carbs etc.  <br/>  <br/> Recently my stomach has also been bloating (only in evenings)so much that my back hurts and I look pregnant! I read all the links from another post on yeast but that just confused me more. I started taking a probiotics (over the counter) but after all that reading I don't even know if that is going to work.  <br/>  <br/> Has anyone tried ThreeLac? I am suspicious of any web site selling stuff...but then again there has to be some good stuff out there  it's just HOW DO YOU KNOW WHO TO BELIEVE?  <br/>  <br/> I also have an ulcer (H. Pylori) and need to get on a combination of  amoxicillin  clarithromycin  and Kapidex (a PPI) Is it safe to take all these antibiotics together??? The GI doc said it was ok but my Int Med doc is out due to a fall and I can't reach her. <br/>  <br/> I HATE taking drugs! I have been 'drug free' most of my life. I didn't take anything but vitamens before this. Now I have a list so long it is scary. <br/>  <br/> Sigh....sorry for the long post and vent. Just looking for some advice (mainly on the yeast) from real people who have been there (vs these long winded web sites that all prove they are the right choice).  <br/>  <br/> I'm sure to have many more questions.

2872.005171,yes,yes,11562,31329,2,0,0,0,I am a 34 year old female and I ended up on this <br/> board because like many of you  I have been  <br/> experiencing numerous 'annoying' symptoms on a  <br/> cyclic basis for years now and unfortunately   <br/> what I could easily ignore in the past has now  <br/> become very persistent. <br/>  <br/> Here's the time-line and the back story.  I also  <br/> want to add that I'm the type of person who  <br/> usually ignores medical issues  figuring that if  <br/> they go away on their own  it's probably not that  <br/> serious. Otherwise I figure I'll just get worse  <br/> and eventually die  that has yet to happen. <br/>  <br/>    2001  <br/>  <br/> I began work at MBNA in Rockland  ME and <br/>  as a result meet a girl on my team and we become  <br/> fast friends.  In May (I think) we came down  <br/> with a bug and it was the worst sore throat of my  <br/> life.  This is pretty much where all these  <br/> annoying things began. My throat was so  <br/> incredibly raw that it brought tears to my  <br/> eyes when I swallowed  my entire neck had swollen  <br/> up and hurt to turn from side to side.  When it  <br/> moved  it felt like it should make a creaking  <br/> sound. I had the worst headache as well.  I  <br/> wasn't worried  after all  it was just a sore  <br/> throat.  But then it didn't go away  nor did the  <br/> swollen tender neck. <br/>  <br/> I went to my PCP grudgingly  tested for Strep   <br/> Negative.  But two months later and this sore  <br/> throat was barely letting go of its hold.  I'd  <br/> get better suddenly and then a week or two later   <br/> back to the same symptoms.  <br/>  <br/> This persisted for about 9 months until the basic <br/>  lingering symptom I had over the next few years  <br/> were cyclic bouts of swollen neck glands   <br/> flu-like fatigue that would last for several days  <br/> and resolve. <br/>  <br/> About two years later I found out that my friend  <br/> (mentioned earlier) had been having seizures and  <br/> that her whole family (her  her son and her  <br/> sister)  including 5 dogs  had tested CDC  <br/> positive for Lyme.  She was diagnosed with  <br/> advanced neuro Lyme and at the time  I pretty  <br/> much scoffed it off as her being overly worried  <br/> about  health issues.  I mean  what is neuro lyme  <br/> I wondered?  I never even gave it a thought that  <br/> since I was there and with her practically every  <br/> single day for 1.5 years.... They estimate the  <br/> onset of infection to when she'd moved from  <br/> Thomaston to Tenants Harbor - I guess the dogs  <br/> were negative prior to the move... and the CDC  <br/> went hog wild investigating that town  it was in  <br/> the news I think because they found so much Lyme  <br/> down there.  This was the time that I spent  <br/> nearly every evening at her house and sat by her  <br/> side every day at work. <br/>  <br/> Probably the one other issue that would come and  <br/> go the most were these days when I would have  <br/> numbness or pain in one side of my face or head.   <br/> Like my jaw would feel numb and I'd tell myself   <br/>  you are so retarded  of course you can feel it!   <br/> so as not to scare myself to death. And in the  <br/> next day  or two it'd be fine.  So I didn't dwell  <br/> on it.  The pain thing was an annoyance though  <br/> and only will happen on one side  mostly on my  <br/> cheek and scalp.  It will literally be so sore to  <br/> the touch that just my eye blinking will hurt  <br/> it.  It lasts for no more than 24 hours and then  <br/> is gone. There's never anything visual to  <br/> indicate why it hurts so bad on my scalp and I  <br/> usually wake up with it like that already.   <br/> Sometimes I get a very fine colorless rash on my  <br/> cheek before it happens.   It's never in the same  <br/> location  it has been my gums  my upper lip  my  <br/> eyebrown  but always just on one side  both the  <br/> pain thing and the numbness thing.  Something  <br/> I've learned to live with. <br/>  <br/>  Summer of 2003  <br/>  <br/> Did some gardening  came back in a few hours  <br/> later with a black spot on my inner wrist.   <br/> Thought it was dirt but it didn't brush off.   <br/> Tried scrubbing really hard didn't budgee. So I  <br/> pop out my nails and take some skin with it.  It  <br/> came off and I brush the skin off on my pants.   <br/> About a week later  on my arm where I'd had that  <br/> tiny black thing on me was this circular rash.   <br/> Not a bulls-eye.  It was raised up a few  <br/> millimeters off my regular skin  perfectly  <br/> smooth  completely flat (like a plateau's top)  <br/> and red.  Hot to the touch and itchy  quarter  <br/> sized.  I showed my dad and he told me it was  <br/> ring worm.  He told me to put Ichthamol on it.   <br/> That didn't work.  Then he told me to put  <br/> Monistat on it.  That didn't work.  Got bigger  <br/> over the course of a couple of weeks  what could  <br/> initially be covered by a bandaid started needing  <br/> a sterile pad.  Max'd out at about 2-3 .  Lasted  <br/> for almost a month.  During that time I had a  <br/> major flu and a bout of the 'glands' that lasted  <br/> for  several weeks.  Also had the swollen neck  <br/> muscle in one side only.  Major fatigue too. <br/>  <br/> And that was my life until 2007.  I didn't feel  <br/> like I was dying or anything  just regularly  <br/> would develop the swollen glands and feel crappy   <br/> then fine  then crappy.  Achey  and sometimes  <br/> even spacey in the mind  not all the time  but  <br/> fairly regularly.   <br/>  <br/> In January of 2007 I woke up one morning with  <br/> muscle spasms.  They were like little twitches  <br/> starting in my face and eye lid  but then  <br/> appeared elsewhere body-wide.  After the  <br/> twitching I noticed that the fingers on my left  <br/> hand  pinky and ring finger were hard to keep  <br/> steady when I was using them.  This terrified me.  <br/> I decided that since I didn't have health  <br/> insurance  the worst I could do is die  so I just  <br/> waited.  The symptoms peaked after about a month  <br/> and then subsided.  Now I notice the same thing  <br/> as the glandular issue.  It comes and goes. <br/>  <br/> That fall I moved to California and for 9 entire  <br/> months I was symptom free for the first time in  <br/> years.  I moved back to Maine in June of 2008 and  <br/> wasn't even on my property for 2 days when I woke  <br/> up in the middle of the night with a deer tick  <br/> embedded in my shin.  I went to the Dr. for  <br/> something unrelated and she discovered the gland  <br/> under my left jaw was enlarged.  She wasn't  <br/> concerned.  I had been going through a lot of  <br/> stress (my dad shot himself on 6/22 and died on  <br/> 7/3).  So all summer I felt like crap   <br/> understandable - my dad committed suicide duh -  <br/> it'll drag you down.  Then in about September  my  <br/> knees started killing me.  Ignored this too as I  <br/> deemed it was possible that it was from how I was  <br/> sitting or whatnot.   <br/>  <br/> In December we lost power for like 6 days and I  <br/> went to my other dad's house to keep warm - keeps  <br/> all his wood inside the house too.  He uses a  <br/> wood stove and let's just say that his house is  <br/> pretty much a barn.  Pigs  chickens  you name it  <br/> run free in there.  Yuck  but we were desperate  <br/> and freezing.   <br/>  <br/> So I get sick  no one else does.  Dragged down   <br/> feverish  and bam  my glands - which were on good  <br/> behavior for many months- swelled up again.   <br/> Funny thing is I never really got better after  <br/> that bout of whatever it was.   <br/>  <br/> December  January and February (after the flu) I  <br/> thought my heart was going to arrest on a few  <br/> occasions it was so agitated.  I couldn't do  <br/> anything to calm it down.  It was jumping around  <br/> like a freak show and terrifying me in the  <br/> process.  In March it started acting better and I  <br/> started to feel a little better as well. <br/>  <br/> I quit smoking in mid-April just after my  <br/> physical.  A couple weeks in I started to feel  <br/> crappy and flu-like again.  Two more weeks went  <br/> by and I had the swollen glands again  this time  <br/> accompanied by a swollen neck (right side only).  <br/> This time a month worth of backache  malaise  <br/> too.   <br/>  <br/> Oh and did I mention that during the week that I  <br/> started getting all glandular again I started  <br/> pulling ticks off me.  3 were Deer ticks. No  <br/> rashes.  But I did get some bruises out of the  <br/> blue that seemed weird.  Now that I think of it   <br/> ever since I lived in Friendship  I've gotten  <br/> cyclic bouts of bruising too - mostly starting in  <br/> June and resolving around August.   <br/>  <br/> Last summer I dug about 50+ ticks off me over the  <br/> summer  many of which were Deer  but the majority  <br/> of which were dog.  None have been fully  <br/> engorged  but plenty have been attached good  <br/> enough to leave a crater and pull skin chunks off  <br/> with them. <br/>  <br/> What I want to know is is it worth me ordering  <br/> this test?  I have no health insurance  I'm a  <br/> full-time non-traditional student who lives on  <br/> pretty much squat for now.  Do I seem to fit a  <br/> Lyme archetype or are these symptoms so vague and  <br/> unrelated it could be anything or even nothing? <br/>  <br/> Is it possible to get Lyme and then have your  <br/> body work through it mostly om its own only to  <br/> get knocked back again at the next tick bite?  If  <br/> even a small percentage of ticks are Lyme+  with  <br/> as many as I have on me per summer makes me  <br/> believe that it's inevitable.  But then that  <br/> sounds so crazy when I reason it out.  Actually   <br/> I feel pretty crazy even posting this to be  <br/> honest.  I've always been of the mind that if it  <br/> goes away  just suffer through it.  Better then  <br/> feeling like a hypochondriac or having your Dr.  <br/> blow you off. <br/>  <br/> Last summer I would be lying in bed and feel them  <br/> dropping off my ceiling and landing on my face.   <br/> At night I'd wake up regularly to pluck them off  <br/> me.  There were so many in my house (after  <br/> countless rounds of poisoning and bombing) that I  <br/> began to keep a bottle filled with alcohol next  <br/> to the bed with tweezers and a lighter.  I  <br/> plucked them  burned them and stuck em in a  <br/> bottle in case they weren't dead yet.   <br/>  <br/>     Persistent ear aches and sensation of fullness <br/> Vertigo <br/> Swollen neck and jaw glands (come and go now every few months) <br/> Sometimes swollen groin or armpits  but they go down after about 2 weeks <br/> Stiff  swollen neck sensation  again regular but not all the time <br/> Fatigue that coincides with fairly regular flu-like feelings <br/> Seeing white/silver sparkly sections in my visual field <br/> Aching Knees that come and go regularly <br/> Muscle twitching over all of body (flares regularly and with stress) <br/> Increasing deafness in right ear <br/> Bouts of unexplained facial numbness and pain that will only last between 24/48 hours <br/> Numbness on my left shin from my knee down to my toes  top side only  and this too comes and goes with severity and time   <br/> PAC's/PVC's  and Sinus Tach <br/> Always freezing (use a portable heater in the summer!) <br/> Warm season bruising     <br/>  I'm up for suggestions or criticism.,10,7,0.112629595,Training,Training
2882.981587,yes,yes,1705,40946,2,0,0,0,I started reading about Lyme a month ago  when on March 19 my 23 year old son got a tick discovered and removed from his back in doctor?s office (he was there complaining about back pain). This tick was there probably 6 days - form March 13 (that?s when my son went on a hike with his friends).  <br/>  <br/> Later  early morning of March 24  5 days after the tick was removed  my son got to the emergency room with flu-like symptoms: very high fever (103F+)  cough  headache  etc. At the hospital  my son did mention a tick. He got several hours of IV (I don?t know what exactly was in it)  and was tested for Lyme and Ehrlichia in addition to the regular blood and urine tests. He was released from the hospital on the same day  feeling better for the rest of the day and the next night. <br/>  <br/> On the next day  March 25  we found out from the hospital that my son tested positive for Ehrlichia  and few hours later he started having rash on his back  which he describes (I didn?t see it) as ?nothing in common with a bulls-eye rash? ? he found a picture of bulls-eye rash on the intranet to compare with his. The hospital prescribed Doxycycline 100mg 2 times a day for him  and he started taking this antibiotic the same day ? March 25. Rash quickly went away  as well as all other symptoms. <br/>  <br/> He continues taking Doxycycline ? up to the total of 6 weeks. <br/>  <br/> I sent the tick to be tested at IGeneX  no result yet. <br/>  <br/> No result of the Lyme test yet which was taken at the hospital on March 24. <br/>  <br/> What should/can we do now to prevent chronic Lyme? What to watch out for?  <br/>  <br/> Thank you very much for all the support the LymeNet community gives me.,7,20,0.043343653,Training,Training

2914.502572,yes,yes,2795,101376,9,0,0,0,Hello all  I'm new here. I got tested for lyme disease a week ago and got my tests yesterday. The lab that did the testing was LabCorp and here are my results: <br/>  <br/> Lyme IgG/IgM Ab: 1.15  (Index 0.00-0.90) <br/>  <br/> Lyme Ab Interp.  EIA: Positive  <br/>  <br/> Lyme IgM by WB: IgM P41 Ab: Positive <br/>  <br/> -All this means Negative for lyme disease (I was told I was a borderline case) <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Nothing else was positive  but I wasn't tested on all the bands either. My vitamin d was low too  which is weird to me because I'm in the sun all the time.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I decided to get tested because I was bitten by a tick in 2001 on my lower back and it was on me for two weeks (thought it was a scab). I pulled on it once while it was embedded and I saw pink flesh and a dark brown ring around it (I'm of color).  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I was told that I probably wasn't infected because I didn't have flu-like symptoms. I didn't knowingly have rapid symptoms  but I notice differences  like allergies  memory loss  and a flu-like illness a few months down the road. <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  I was in high school at the time and almost never go sick and had stellar attendance. I started being absent from class more and more from fatigue. I'm surprised I graduated high school lol. <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  Now I'm in college and for much longer than I should be because my memory has deteriorated terribly and I have debilitating fatigue. I've considered putting school on hold until I get better  but I don't know about that idea. <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  I have many other symptoms but I'm not going to bore anyone. Let's just say most of my symptoms are neurological. It's so bad that I traveled back to my home state and missed my final exams to seek treatment.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Let me also mention that I worked these last two summers in a park in a highly infested tick area in Maryland. I had an ugly bite that I thought was caused by a spider because it had a center  was raised like a hard bump  and was itchy  but I soon had a ring around that as well and took months to heal.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I was given a two-week trial of doxy as a precaution and was on it while I was tested  so that could've had an effect on my results. I just finished and it seemed like my symptoms worsened since stopping. My test was done by a normal doctor. <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  Since I didn't qualify for lyme according to the CDC  there has to be some type of spirolette(?) that I have an antibody to. It's making me nervous.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I guess I should see a LLMD  but I'm a college student who can't afford to see one at this time unless they take insurance. I don't know what to do right now. <br/>   <br/>   [ 24. December 2008  12:51 AM: Message edited by: GDP ] ,14,11,0.075471698,Training,Training

2989.514378,yes,yes,2165,69520,30,0,0,0,Hi I'm new here and recently diagnosed with Lyme Disease.  It appears I have Borrelia  Babesia  and Bartonella.  I only tested positive for the Babesia  but my Dr. thinks I have the Bartonella as well.  It appears I've had this for a year now  but can't say for sure. <br/>  <br/> Something is causing my heart to race.  At rest its about 105 and if I get up and walk across to my kitchen  my rate goes into the 140's.  My rate has always been in the 60's.  I'm also getting short of breath with any kind of exertion. I feel like my anxiety is going 24/7.  I'm also shaking alot like I have parkinsons.  Lastly  even after 10 hours of sleep  I feel so weak and can barely keep my eyes open and have no energy to do anything.  I have had all of this and many other symptoms for a while now  but these are the main symptoms that really seem to be worse 10 fold since I started on meds 2 days ago.  Here is the list: <br/>  <br/> Tindamax 250mg twice per day <br/> Bactrim 1 tab twice per day <br/> Biaxin 1 tab twice per day <br/> N-Acetyl Cystine 1 tab twice per day <br/> B12 Sublingual 1 tab once per day <br/> Mycelex troch 1 tab on the tongue 4 x day <br/>  <br/> BTW  the Dr. gave my Glucothione and B12 by IV injection in her office 3 days ago.  There was some Niacin in it and I believe some Magnesium too.  My anxiety went through the roof after this infusion and I had a terrible air hunger attack too.  But it went away after a few hours and I started the antibiotics the day after.  I was at my baseline before starting the antibiotics. <br/>  <br/> I'm taking Xanax and Klonopin too  but it doesn't seem to cut into the anxiety or help with any of this.  Again  these symptoms have gotten worse since starting on these meds just 2 days ago.  I took today off  but no better.  This lasted a good part of the day too  I left that out.   <br/>  <br/> So the question is  which of these medications that I'm taking is making all of this worse ?  Or is this just part of Herxing ?  I appreciate any opinions in advance.  I hate this disease because I feel so alone.  When I hear others have the same thing  it gives me some peace of mind. <br/>  <br/> Shannon,14,22,0.040380048,Training,Training

If someone could relate to my symptoms and at least relate to me I would probably be less upset.  I can't tell you how many times I'v e thought about going to the emergency room. I was not diagnosed with lyme until Jan 6 2009  almost 6 months after my first symptom. I had a low grade fever in Sept for 17 days 5 of which I spent in a hospital. I went on doxycyclene for 30 days  twice a day that ended on feb 6. I have no improvement and to be honest I feel worse. Recently I started getting headaches and sometimes I wake up with buzzing in my ears at night. My right foot is partially numb most of the day and I've been getting cold feelings on my head and legs sporadically throughout the day. I have a pain in my ribs on the right side that come and go along with a nauseous feeling. My left hand goes partially numb from time to time as well as my right. Sometimes my left arm is killing me also. Pins and needles on my face  arms and legs. All these symptoms come and go but I never feel 100%. Just recently my feet have muscle twitches on and off throughout the day. I'm scheduled for a spinal tap next week. Anybody else fell at least some of the things I do? What do I do? My infectious disease Dr basically said I was done with him after the doxycyclene  he didn't even schedule me for a follow-up. He said it might take months for the antibiotics to kick in.

The only band that came back positive was the 41Igm-nothing else. At the time I had my blood drawn  I did have an active infection going on that I was treating myself with antivirals for  and I'm wondering if that infection was what caused the positive 41 for me. I'm really scared about this-does this band always mean Lyme  or is 41Igg more indicative of the disease? My sister's WB came back with positive 41Igg only  and she has every Lyme symptom in the book. We are both really confused about this! Should I follow up in a few weeks with another WB to see if the same band is reactive or not? And if it is  what do I do then? Any suggestions? Thanks!,11,148,0,Training,Training

At the start of the 3 weeks I became very tierd and wore out.  <br/>  <br/> At the end of my treatment I fell at work and broke 2 ribs. <br/>  <br/>  while I was in the Dr office I asked if I could still have Lymes because I still have been feeling Tierd and wore out. <br/>  <br/>  The Dr said Docycyline always takes care of Lymes. <br/>  <br/>  1 month ago I started getting a rash of Migraine headaces every other day. <br/>  <br/>  I went to a difrent Dr and asked if Docycyline always kills Lymes she said yes and just gave me some meds for my Migraines. <br/>  <br/>  I thought that being tierd and wore out all the time could be causeing My Migraines.  <br/>  <br/> I went in to my normal Dr. a few days Latter and told him that I still thought I had Lymes.  <br/>  <br/> I was then tested and it came back Positive.  <br/>  <br/> He has prescribed me  4 weeks of Docycycline. <br/>  <br/>  I guess I am concerned that Docycyline did not take care of my Lymes in the very early stages. <br/>  <br/>  Why will this take care of it now after 6 months of having lymes.

I was able to check most of the boxes. <br/>  <br/> I am broke and can't afford the testing more or less an LLMD  so I started using a Rife machine that belongs to a guy just 20 min. away from where I live.   <br/>  <br/> I am only using the Lyme frequencies from the CAFL list that was given to the gentleman who is helping me out by letting me use his Rife machine. <br/>  <br/> I just did my first treatment 2 days ago and ever since then I have felt very weak and tired  I'm having terrible headaches and trouble concentrating.  I'm dizzy and having heart palpitations.  I have this pain behind my eyes that makes me feel like I'm tired when I'm not even sure that I am. <br/>  <br/> I didn't have any of these symptoms before I used his machine  so I would guess this is a Herheimer reaction.   <br/>  <br/> Would anyone consider this to be confirmation of the disease ?  I have been searching for so long to find out what is wrong with me.  I started with really bad depression and depersonalizing as my initial symptoms a few years back  but over the years I have developed other symptoms of just not feeling well (hard to explain).  Then I started having Panic attacks out of nowhere and I would get these shortness of breath attacks when I wasn't even anxious  like I couldn't get enough air. <br/>  <br/> After lots of research and talking to others in some forums  it was suggested that I should look into Lyme disease.  Again  I answered these checklists as if I wrote them myself. <br/>  <br/> So again  I ask you that if I am having these reactions from the Rife therapy  that again  was only set on Lyme disease frequencies  would this be confirmation of the disease and to keep treating. <br/>  <br/> I am broke from being out of work.

But he also has low muscle tone and tight muscles in his neck.  He complained of a few headaches  but he seems to feel pretty good physically.

Of course  I am also impatient and want to know  how long  will it take for him to get better.  I am being told there is no average time  this is fairly easy to treat in kids = it is typically less severe than regular Lyme and his prognosis is excellent.

Do I really have lyme? <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Yes  I did test positive for lyme and coinfections when I was tested 5 years ago.  <br/>  <br/> But  I've been told by more than one infectious disease doctor in well-known hospitals  that 90% of people who live in rural NY areas would test positive for lyme  if they were given the test. They aren't tested  so they don't know about it and never need treatment.  <br/>  <br/> Meaning  just because you test positive  doesn't mean you need treatment. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> So all this makes me wonder. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Is there any foolproof way to know if you have it? And when treatment is done  do u test negative? So you know it's gone? Beyond doubt? Relying on personal symptoms  especially when you're not sure what's really going on in your body (and you have more diagnoses than you are years old) seems confusing to me. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I guess I just don't trust myself  and my knowledge of my body  enough. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Does/did anyone else doubt whether or not they have/had lyme?  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> This may be wishful thinking on my part  I know...but I'm still wondering. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I'd love to hear thoughts on this. <br/>   <br/>   [ 05-03-2009  10:08 PM: Message edited by: fighter ] ,20,6,0.126760563,Training,Training
3282.116939,yes,yes,1477,68827,1,0,0,0,I've had CFS for 29 years. Last June I started getting swelling of joints and the tissue surrounding them (possibly the tendons). In July I got acute lyme (with rash) and was treated with doxy for 3 weeks. But the joint pain  and swelling have continued and is progressive-- more and more joints are affected-fingers  wrists  elbows  ankles  shoulder and feet so far  and the ones that are affected stay affected. <br/>  <br/> In addition to the swelling my affected joints hurt. They have a dull ache all the time  and a sharp pain when I use them. Also  they crackle alot-even the bones in my hands crackle. <br/>  <br/> I have been to a rheumatologist and he checked me for EVERYTHING and found nothing. He did find that in my Western blot I had one abnormal finding (Igm P23). So he sent me to an infectious disease doctor. The infectious disease doctor basically blew me off. He said I don't have lyme and my joints don't look that bad to him!!! <br/>  <br/> I know lyme causes swelling of the joints  but from what I've read it migrates from joint to joint instead of staying in the affected joint. <br/>  <br/> Also  it seem to be more that my tendons or connective tissue around my joints are affected. Does lyme affect the tendons? <br/>  <br/> Does anyone else out there have the same thing? Do you know what causes it and how to stop it? <br/>  <br/> Are there any good articles that specifically address joint  tendon and connective tissue problems? <br/>          ,4,17,0.049429658,Training,Training

My nuro said he really doesnt understand the IGX test results and wanted to talk to an Infectious diease Dr  Because I guess there was a band number 40  that he wasn't sure about. (He made an odd comment  he said if you test the blood enough  he was referring to 40  then you would get a positive) I don't have a copy yet of my results. I've asked for a copy.

3294.737702,yes,yes,1123,62083,1248,0,0,0,Hello all  <br/>  <br/> I have been taking Minocycline 100mg TID for a little over 3 weeks now along with Tindamax 500mg TID. <br/>  <br/> Its been shaky going  and unfortunately  I have had to back off a few times already.  <br/>  <br/> Yesterday something new popped up and I am wondering if this newest symptom is actually one from a side effect of the meds or just part of herxing. <br/>  <br/> The timing points to a herx  but thought I would ask anyway... <br/>  <br/> Sooo  yesterday  my mouth became very sore to the point of aching. After a few hours  I could feel specific places on the roof of my mouth that felt swollen and tender. <br/>  <br/> My glands also were swollen along with all the regular symptom list. <br/>  <br/> Today  those tender spots are now open sores  and I am having a difficult time eating anything due to the pain. <br/>  <br/> So  the question is...have any of you experienced this or even heard of this with Tindamax or Minocycline? <br/>  <br/> I've tried drug searches and can't seem to locate any answers on this specific issue. <br/>  <br/> Thanks so much in advance  <br/> Melanie,12,8,0.103960396,Training,Training
3304.743515,yes,yes,1403,21353,5,0,0,0,Hello  <br/>  <br/> I am 23 years old and was diagnosed almost 3 years ago with idiopathic transverse myelitis. While in the hospital paralyzed from the shoulders down  I was treated with IV antibiotics and steroids for the inflammation in my spinal cord  I and was tested for everything  including Lyme  but no cause was ever found. <br/>  <br/> Before becoming ill  I was a completely healthy college student. Now I am numb on most of the left side of my body  and I have chronic fatigue. Anxiety is a daily battle  I have random shooting pains in different parts of my body (mostly upper abdomen) and I have muscle spasms in my legs and arms. I also have to take medicine for over active bladder. I feel like a 23 year old senior citizen (no offense to the older members!) <br/>  <br/> I would be content with diagnosis if it was not for my experience with Lyme as a child. I was treated for Lyme when I was 9 years old. After a vacation in Arkansas where I was bitten by a tick on the shoulder  I developed a lot of the early symptoms of the disease. My pediatrician tested me for Lyme  but the test was negative. I was treated with antibiotics just in case and eventually got better. I never thought about Lyme Disease again until this mysterious disorder  TM  entered my life. <br/>  <br/> I was just wondering if this could possibly be Lyme even though I've tested negative twice  11 years apart.,4,27,0.031128405,Training,Training
3307.499052,no,yes,1729,99994,4288,2,0,0,<br/>  <br/> Your doctor may have consulted the CDC and  even with positive labs  the CDC has additional burdens to a positive dx. <br/>  <br/> I do think you need someone to determine what happened.   It still comes down to most doctors thinking this is no big deal  sadly. <br/>  <br/> I'd ask your local support group if they know of an attorney whom you could consult - not that it would go anywhere for the CDC and IDSA still say lyme is no big deal - but I'd like to see you get an advocate and legal guidance. <br/>  <br/> I'd love to be able to sit down with legal counsel and ask the doctor  why?   - I'd really want to know  why?  you were just being dropped. <br/>  <br/> Best case scenario is that the doctor may wake up  see the error and learn much more  becoming an expert. <br/>  <br/> I'm sure you feel like you lost 8 years of your life due to this doctor  though.   So  that's very tough. <br/>  <br/> In '97  I had positives from Igenex for lyme  babesia and an ehrlichia.  Tests were ordered by my ND  though as my MD refused the correct tests.   And when the correct tests were presented to the MD  she totally dismissed it. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> So  the bottom line is bad doctors are just bad news.  Move along as best you can to get well but alerting your local support group to that doctor  at the least.   <br/>  <br/> As far a real legal action  you'd not have much to stand on since the IDSA position is so weak and they deny chronic lyme.   Unless you have an excellent attorney and the means to pursue this. <br/>  <br/> At least  it would be good to have an attorney at least write a letter so that that doctor may know to take this more seriously for those who come along now. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> -,13,8,0.086956522,Training,Training

3320.236789,yes,yes,1449,42847,6,0,0,0,I have been fighting lyme and babesia for almost a year and a half. I have no idea when I got it since I never saw a tick bite or had a rash.  I have been feeling awful for many years though.  I did not test positive for babs but my LLMD says my symptoms are indicative of lyme and babesia. (I've only been on meds targeting babesia for about 6 mos.)  I have been on many antibiotics over the past year  but the ones for babesia that I have tried are malarone and flagyl.  With both  I have gotten somewhat better but kind of reached a plateau and still have many symptoms.  Recently my doc changed my medications to Bactrim and Mepron.  I have had herxes with some of the other meds  but I reacted terribly on day 2 of this combo.  I had chills  brain fog (which is expected) but the worst fatigue I have ever experienced.  He then advised me to take half of the dose of Mepron (was taking 1 tsp/2 times a day  now taking 1/2 tsp/2 times a day) and to stay on the same dose of the Biaxin.  I have tried that and the fatigue is so bad that all I do is sleep.  I work a full time job and have to be able to function.  I was off today and slept the whole day away.  I can deal with a little fatigue  but I cannot function like this.  Has this happened to anyone and does anyone have any suggestions on a different protocol?  When I was on the Bactrim  it energized me and I don't understand why he took me off of that???  Please give me your thoughts.,8,287,0,Training,Training

3387.674802,yes,yes,1163,22990,358,5,0,0,Venus -  <br/>  <br/> Do you recall how long the agitation lasted?  One of my 5 year old twins has been on it for 2 months now and I am not seeing any improvement in his hiper  agitated behavior or his OCD symptoms.  It has actually gotten a bit worse.  I was hoping to see a change for the better by now. <br/>  <br/> My other twin boy started it about the same time and he got worse initially  (rages  tantrums  anger) but after about 5 to 6 weeks  he started making a turnaround.  Now after 10 weeks  he smiles much of the time and his anger and rages are almost completely gone. <br/>  <br/> Momwithhope - with regard to the physical symptoms of muscle pain that my second twin had  they went away almost immediately after starting the rifampin.  He did wet his bed twice during the first month  which I think was a herx.  The psych issues took longer  as I mentioned above. <br/>  <br/> Also  I give it to my boys about an hour before breakfast and dinner.  I open the capsules and mix them in applesauce.  They haven't complained of any side effects  but they did seem more tired that first week on it. <br/>  <br/> Hope this helps! <br/>  <br/> tickbattler,12,15,0.055555556,Training,Training

She is totally asymptomatic for Lyme.  She had an extensive exam with my LLMD who confirmed that she has no symptoms whatsoever.  The doc went so far as to say that an Igenex western blot was not necessary be we opted to do it anyway.  <br/>  <br/> The Igenex test found that she had prior exposure to lyme but no current infection (CDC negative on both counts). <br/>  <br/> Now my LLMD strongly recommends 3 months of Doxy just to be safe.  This will mean hundreds of dollars on top of my thousands of dollars of medical bills plus the obvious discomforts of treatment for an ailment that she may not have. <br/>  <br/> Has anyone else had a similar experience or can share some insights?

I have heard it is very inaccurate for detecting lyme  so I'm not sure what the point of it would be. <br/>  <br/> Also - I see you mention you already have an LLMD for your son.  I know we have talked in the past...just curious  do you go to Dr. J? <br/>  <br/> I live in the Philly area and whenever I hear about IDSA docs treating lyme  it seems the  good  ones (who actually think lyme can be serious) are very aggressive about doing IV treatment right up front.  But I always hear they do 30 days (maybe 60) and then are done (not good).

3452.289499,yes,yes,1245,9530,4,0,0,0,I was bit by a tick in Cook County IL (outside Chicago) 2.5 weeks ago.  I figure it was probably in my head for approximately 5 days.   <br/>  <br/> I researched online and the CDC said in 2007 that 32% of ticks in Cook Cty are infected.  The IL Dept of Health said in 2009 that over 20% of ticks in Cook Cty are infected.   <br/>  <br/> I started experiencing headaches almost daily after a few days.  Last week I got a very stiff sore neck that has lasted a full 6 days.   <br/>  <br/> I went to my doctor who told me there is an extremely low change I have Lyme disease since I have no fever or rash and she prescribed me an anti-inflammatory instead.  She refused to put me on an antibiotic as she assessed the risk as so low.   <br/>  <br/> I have been using the anti-inflammatory but my neck is still stiff and sore.  So far I don't have any other symptoms I am aware of.  (I am exhausted  but then I'm always tired).  I am very concerned  especially because my neck has been sore so long for no other known reason.   <br/>  <br/> Please advise.

3454.628523,yes,yes,2322,40426,5,0,0,0,I was only three when I first contracted Lyme. Still  I remember it well. I remember waking in the bathroom unable to stand the glare of the bright light. My father was in front of me slapping my face begging me to wake up. <br/>  <br/> I wanted to tell him I was awake  but my head hurt so bad and my skin burned. I closed my eyes and the ringing in my ears turned to sirens. <br/>  <br/> I was diagnosed with encephalitis. Later  I was brought in to have a tick removed from behind my ear. <br/>  <br/> I nearly died  or so I?ve been told. I spent the next year or two having horrible nightmares and hallucinations. Nobody knew about Lyme back then and all anyone could do was pray. <br/>  <br/> During my school years I had a lot of illnesses difficulty in school and pain in my legs that eventually moved to my hip by the time I reached my teens.  <br/>  <br/> Later in my 20?s the low back pain started. I was finally diagnosed with sacroiliitis at the age of 32. After a horrible ordeal with medications  I decided to deal with it myself and abandon the medical community. <br/>  <br/> Unfortunately  I still had the occasional hospital visit due to kidney infection  diverticulitis and pains that I just couldn?t bear. <br/>  <br/> On February 26th of this year  my adopted little brother passed away. That very day the headaches began in the back of my head. <br/>  <br/> More symptoms followed?stiff neck  shortness of breath  crushing chest pain  shaking and tingly hands  short term memory loss  confusion  rage  loss of appetite  unusual clumsiness  eye pain  fevers  fatigue and a strange purple 3inch diameter circle/ring  on my skin. <br/>  <br/> That was when I stumbled across an article about Lyme.   <br/>  <br/> Since I cannot afford an actual LLMD  I tried to put my trust in my regular doctor figuring my symptoms were too obvious to ignore. I had the tick  the rash and the symptoms. <br/>  <br/> She referred me to a neurologist  but my appointment isn?t until July.  <br/>  <br/> In the meantime she wants to experiment with migraine medication and muscle relaxers for my head aches. I tend to have severe reactions with new meds so I?m scared to take them.  <br/>  <br/> Am I being paranoid  or does this not sound like a very good idea? <br/>  <br/> (The medications are EPIDRIN and TIZANIDINE.),3,13,0.06746988,Training,Training
3456.080965,yes,yes,3991,31350,1,0,0,0,Good Morning  <br/>  <br/> Let me apologize for the length of this from the start. To give a little history  I was diagnosed with Lyme back in 1992 while in the Navy in Newport Rhode Island. I believe  looking back  that I actually had it for about 2 years prior to being diagnosed. The Navy and Civilian doctors that I had seen prior to that just didn?t put the pieces together. It all started in 1990 while my ship was in dry-dock in Boston Ma. The ship sponsored a day trip to play paint ball in Lebanon ME. With in a few days  I started getting pain in my jaw. The Corpsman on the ship sent me to the dentist. Shortly after that  the headaches came. They were massive and lasted for up to 24 hours. I was taken to St Elizabeth?s Hospital in Boston numerous times  where I was given all types of tests. MRI  CAT scan  Spinal Tap  ECT and no one could figure out why I was having these headaches. I ended up with Bells Palsy on the left side of my face. My left eye is droopy to this day. This went on for months. They wondered if I was allergic to something in the shipyard  or the ship. My headaches eventually stopped coming and the Neurology Dept in St Elizabeth?s diagnosed me with Cluster Head Aches. Now fast forward a few years. My ship is now home ported in Newport RI. I start getting rashes all over my body. They were mostly on my legs  but did have some on my chest and stomach. I was being seen by the Dermatology dept at the Naval Hospital in Newport.  They kept taking biopsies and could not figure out what it was. The rashes would move around  but never actually went away. I was seeing my Dr. one day  and he took me to a more senior Dr  A Commander and asked him to look at my rashes to get his opinion. He looked at me for a minute or two and asked if I had been checked for Lyme. They had me go give blood and I found out a day or two later that I was positive for the Lyme teeter. I had never heard of Lyme at that time. My ship was getting underway  so they opted to have me take pills over the intravenously administered drugs. I was deemed cured after the regime of pills. I always wondered how they actually know that I was cured  but I was cured none the less. All my symptoms went away anyhow. Now lets fast forward again to 1996 or 1997. My rashes came back. I was now stationed in sunny California. I went to Medical and told the Dr that I saw that the last time I had a rash like this; I was diagnosed with Lyme disease. I was told  ?We don?t have Lyme Disease in California? and he gave me a cream to put on it and that was that. A year or so later  we transferred back to the east coast to Virginia Beach Va. I still had my rash on my legs. I had to get a physical while there and the Dr asked me about my Rash. I told her the same story I told the guy in California. She had my blood drawn and told me that she could see that I had Lyme in the past  but it was not active. She sent me to Dermatology at the Portsmouth Naval Hospital where I stayed a patient up until I retired. I would go in and they would take a biopsy. It would come back with no real results  so they would tell me it was eczema. The rash went away about a year before I retired in 2007. I was rash free for about two years  but they are back. I now have two large  red rashes  one on each shin. Over the last year  my new civilian Dr has been trying to figure out why my liver enzymes are elevated. I am on cholesterol meds and at first she thought it was due to that. She had me stop my meds  but my enzymes actually went up even higher. She put me back on my meds. I have had two ultra sounds of my liver that showed some fatty tissue  but otherwise normal. She called me yesterday and told me that I now need a biopsy of my liver. I am scheduled for that next Thursday  the 14th of May. I guess my real questions is this? Could this still be tied back to when I had Lyme in 1992? Did they maybe not kill it when they gave me those pills back then? Thanks for listening.  <br/> Rob,9,199,0.003740648,Training,Training
3468.039551,yes,yes,3428,48791,66,0,0,0,Hi   <br/> Here is my story. I have been lurking here since August or Sept of 2008 but never registered. <br/>  <br/> I am a 32 year old mother of two (ages 2 & 5). I am lucky enough to be able to stay at home with my girls.  <br/>  <br/> I developed a swollen knee in July 2008.  <br/>  <br/> I was doing a lot of running and was trying to master an 8-min mile.  <br/>  <br/> I did it and got a swollen knee.  <br/>  <br/> I had broken my knee while in high school so I thought this was a sports injury.  <br/>  <br/> I had no previous symptoms or remember a tick.  <br/>  <br/> I went to the doc and her first thought was Lyme.  <br/>  <br/> I tested positive on all three bands on the Western Blot.  <br/>  <br/> My symptoms after the knee swelled was tingling... lots of it. I was also very tired.  <br/>  <br/> I was treated with Doxy. 100mg 2x a day for 28 days. I felt better.  <br/>  <br/> About a week later I actually found a tick on me!  <br/>  <br/> I ran to the doc and was given one 200mg dose of Doxy.  <br/>  <br/> After two weeks my symptoms returned.  <br/>  <br/> Tingling  anxiety  panic at times  fatigue... Awful. I was so emotional.  <br/>  <br/> I went back on Doxy 200mg twice a day for 2 1/2 months.  <br/>  <br/> I stopped and was feeling better.  <br/>  <br/> I wish I stayed on at this point.   <br/>  <br/> I saw a LLMD and she wanted to add Flagyl but I was scared.  <br/>  <br/> I am not one to even take Tylenol for a headache and drugs freak me out.   <br/>  <br/> My family doc that diagnosed me with Lyme urged me to stop.  <br/>  <br/> I felt good for three months. <br/>  <br/> Every month before I got my period I would feel worse than normal but it would pass. <br/>   <br/> After the third month I started exercising a lot more.  <br/>  <br/> I was also dealing with a lot of stress.  <br/>  <br/> We got a big snow and I shoveled the whole driveway which was a lot of work. I felt awful.  <br/>  <br/> I started getting really tired during the day.  <br/>  <br/> I still pushed through and exercised but it got to be too much.  <br/>  <br/> I was also feeling depressed and had completely lost my sex drive.   <br/>  <br/> Well  I finally went to the doc.  <br/>  <br/> She ran every blood test under the sun and everything came back normal except for the Lyme. <br/>  <br/> I was positive on two bands (IgM).   <br/>  <br/> Now I am back on Doxy. 200mg 2x a day for who knows?  <br/>  <br/> I am already starting to feel better.  <br/>  <br/> My main problems are that my eyes are sensitive to the sun (and my eyes are very dry so it makes it all worse)  I get tired during the day and I know you all will understand this... I just don't feel like myself. I feel off and funny sometimes.  <br/>  <br/> Today I started exercising again and it felt good.   <br/>  <br/> I am going to see an Infectious Disease doc next week.  I know  I need a LLMD...  <br/>  <br/> I was recently tested for co-infections through LabCorp and they were all negative.  <br/>  <br/> I respond very well to oral meds. Can you offer any advice??  <br/>  <br/> Currently I am taking the Doxy 400mg a day.  <br/>  <br/> I also take a Multivitamin  Vit C 500mg  Vitamin D 3000IU  Florastor  2 Culturelle  1200mg Fish Oil  B-12 & an extra Calcium  D  Zinc  Magnesium.  <br/>  <br/> What else should I take?  <br/>  <br/> Thank you so much for taking the time to read! <br/>  <br/> I edited this and broke it up...,7,6,0.132621951,Training,Training

I understand that abx give symptoms of sun sensitivity. <br/>  <br/> I have had lyme disease practically my whole life since I was 7  and am now 28.  I have tried many treatments over the past few years including abx  rife  herbs  diet  acupuncture  supplements  etc. etc. many of which have helped.   I also have had a majority of the Lyme symptoms  anxiety and back pain being my biggest most frustrating symptoms  however  a new one has become prevalent that I can't find ANY info on....  <br/>  <br/> A couple years ago I noticed I was sensitive to the sun  however  not skin sensitive.  I was at a football game and it was a clear sunny day and I started feeling extremely fatigued  overheated  anxiety  then I had the chills  and felt awful for the rest of the day.  Throughout the couple years  my sensitivity was pretty mild until now.  Over the last couple weeks were the first sunny days of this spring.  It has been 55 to 65 degrees and sunny. I took a ride in the car and almost instantly felt anxiety  hot  and 5 minutes later at my destination was tired and had the chills.  It was the same on the way back.  I literally can't be in the sun at all  and even driving to work at 8am effects me.  I am EXTREMELY discouraged about this because I have been for the most part a lot better from various treatments.  Now I can't set my foot into the sun or else I get this reaction.  WHAT IS THIS?????  Anyone else have this experience or know ANYTHING about this???  Please help!!  This is not me at all... I love the outdoors... I can't go on with my life dodging the sun.  I am resorting to shadow hopping and feel like a freak.,12,65,0.012158055,Training,Training

3479.281511,yes,yes,1389,9911,9,34,0,0,Well I went back to the doctor that did the lyme's disease test.  I had a different doctor this time and she told me my test came back negative and that I didn't have Lyme's disease. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I told her my situation (dizzy  lightheaded  loss of right side peripheral vision  trouble reading  etc...) and she didn't really have any answers for me.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> She took more blood and ran another test  for what I'm not sure.  Anyway she came back in and said to keep my appointment with the neurologist on the 15th but for now they were going to treat this as a sinus infection             <br/>  <br/>  <br/> She prescribed prednisone (steroid) and azithromycen (antibiotic).  I have been taking them for 3 days with no noticeable improvements.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I'm still just as disabled with my right peripheral and I still have the dizziness.  I requested to have a Lyme's disease test by Igenex but everyone around here is hell bent on lab corp and refuses to take any other route.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> None of the doctors will order the kit.  I called Igenex and tried to order it myself and just have the doctor sign off and draw the blood but they won't send out a kit unless it's to a physician. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> What am I supposed to do?  Apparently the closest LLMD is in Tennessee.  That's about a 5 hour haul for me.  I don't know what else to do.,41,12,0.071713147,Training,Training

3508.252803,yes,yes,2729,41264,3,0,0,0,Hi everyone  <br/>   Thanks for taking a look at my post.  I am so sad today  because I feel down in the dumps like I am not getting anywhere.  I know that you may or may not be medical professionals  but I hope that you can provide some insight for me. <br/>  <br/>   I am 31  married  no children yet.  For the last 4 years my symptoms have gotten worse and I don't know what to do.  I have seen 13 doctors in the last 4 years  had several blood tests  MRIs  XRays  prescriptions  therapists.. etc.  I have been diagnosed with everything from depression to food allergies.  <br/>  <br/>  I am always told that I am normal - which I wish were true because I sure don't feel normal. <br/>  <br/>  My symptoms in the last 4 years have been: <br/> 1) extreme fatigue - it's been very hard to get up in the morning  it seems I need about 10-12 hours of sleep.  <br/>  <br/> 2) extreme joint pain - my right knee mostly. It feels like such sever arthritis that I cannot walk sometimes  for instance  I am home from work today - it's really interfereing with my life. On occassion it affects my neck  middle fingers  thumb joint  knee  shoulder joint - they have been in slings  braces  and such because they hurt so badly.  <br/>  <br/> 3) Jaw clenching - this is new within the last 2 months and has been persistent for the last 2 months.  <br/>  <br/> 4) in the last 4 weeks I have been an emotional mess - it seems I am overly sensitive to cry such as simply walking down the hallway at work I get teary  mostly because I feel so tired and run down.   <br/>  <br/> 5) right flank pain has been daily for around the last 8 weeks  I wonder if I'm making a kidney stone? I had one once... <br/>  <br/> I have had various blood works and would be willing to provide those to a professional. I have a file I carry with me now. SED rates  CBC  Vitamin D  Lyme  Lupus  Thyroid  all show normal or negative. <br/>  <br/> The last doctor I saw ran an IgG blood test for food sensitivieis and found I have 28 food sensitivities such as wheat  eggs  milk  lettuce  citrus  etc.  <br/>  <br/>  He says these foods cause me horrible arthritis and fatigue.  Do they really?  Is this the cause or bunk? I have been eliminating these foods on a regular basis but have not been this sensative before  if it is indeed the foods. <br/>  <br/> Long story short  I am so lost and would appreciate any guidance.  I know the symptoms of Lyme can mimick something else (does any know what the something else can be?)  <br/>  <br/> Also  the Lyme results are negative  so I should assume I do not have that  right? <br/>  <br/> Thanks for any insight you can provide! <br/> Lost in WY <br/>   <br/>   [ 04-16-2009  02:26 PM: Message edited by: wasson23 ] ,9,15,0.060665362,Training,Training
3509.816587,no,yes,1580,21340,31,0,0,0,Funds are a little tight right now  but I do have health insurance. So  I want to bring this first to my general practitioner  but I want to be sure I'm asking the right questions and requesting the right tests. <br/>  <br/> A couple years ago  they did a lyme disease test. I don't know what kind it was  but it apparently came back negative. I am now inclined to look closer at this  having just learned about how some tests are either easily misread or inately misleading  and seeing how it fits my symptoms so very precisely. <br/>  <br/> What's the most likely test they did on my a few years ago? <br/>  <br/> Which is more definitive - the spinal fluid culture or the LUAT? Should I ask for both or one? <br/>  <br/> I feel like I should ask for a Western Blot as well to compare what would be standard results with one of the two above. Is this a good idea? <br/>  <br/> When I ask for a more comprehensive Lyme panel  I guess I should also ask for a test for babesiosis and erlichiosis. What are the names of the tests involved for these?  <br/>  <br/> Are there other common lyme-borne diseases that I should be checking? <br/>  <br/> Are there tests I should specifically ask for or ask to avoid? <br/>  <br/> What kind of opposition am I likely to face from a standard doctor when asking for these kinds of tests? My current doctor knows all my symptomology and knows nothing else has worked so far. Is there anything I should avoid saying that might make things worse when asking for these tests? <br/>   <br/>   [ 06-05-2009  07:23 PM: Message edited by: gr33nman ] ,13,14,0.061643836,Training,Training

Dekrator48  is seeing the same doc   <br/>  <br/> and she has posted some    great summaries   about his work. <br/>  <br/> His knowledge but also passion is extremely evident to me. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> On my second month  I started taking Mepron to combat Babesia. <br/>  <br/> I had a question about maximizing the absorption of Mepron with fats. <br/>  <br/> Dr. S. emphasized that plant-based fats are not effective in absorbing the Mepron. <br/>  <br/> He recommended I use animal fats such as butter or cheese. <br/>  <br/> I wanted to ask everyone here if you've heard any evidence to shed some light on this situation. <br/>  <br/> I could not find ANY research online that specifically talks about Mepron with animal fats. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The reason I ask is that I am not entirely comfortable consuming high amounts of animal fat. <br/>  <br/> I used to be a vegetarian/vegan  and passionate about  and more at ease  consuming a plant-based diet   <br/>  <br/> and I always especially avoided animal fats.  Even though deep down I didn't want to  I changed  <br/>  <br/> my diet around when I became unhealthy  <br/>  <br/> especially because everyone around me looked at my  unconventional  diet as the cause for why I  <br/>  <br/> felt so bad.  The real reason I felt the way I did  I know now was Lyme and friends. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Has anyone else heard or have research/evidence pointing to a reason why animal fats would  <br/>  <br/> be more advantageous for absorbing Mepron? <br/>  <br/> I currently have been taking it with peanut butter  macadamia nuts  etc  but added some organic  <br/>  <br/> cream cheese into the mix after Dr. S's told me about animal fat. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Thank you everyone  <br/>  <br/> Sean.,4,5,0.146627566,Training,Training

3620.777009,no,yes,1584,37010,288,10,0,0,If you herx on other Lyme treatments and not using the GB  something is likely wrong.  Either that or you have already lowered your bacterial load enough that your body can easily handle the killing effect. <br/>  <br/> Let assume it is not the last scenario.  There are only so many possibilities. <br/>  <br/> 1) the machine is not working  or you are not using it correctly. <br/>  <br/> Out of the box  with the default settings it should work.  Are you using the amplifier and is it turned to the max output?  When the GB is running is it indicating that the frequencies are being run?  Are all the wires conducting electricity. I would check them with an amp probe.  They are the weak link in the machine. <br/>  <br/> 2) Your symptoms are either mostly being caused by a coinfection  that does not have a herx reaction.  You also could have another coinfection that you have not treated for. <br/>  <br/> Or you have another disease that is similar to Lyme  would respond to a oral Lyme treatment  but not necessarily Lyme frequency treatments. <br/>  <br/> There is really only one possibility here.  I am not suggesting you have this  but the only other disease like this  is Syphilis.  If this is a possibility  then try the Syphilis frequencies and see what happens.  This will not mean you have it  because the Syphilis frequencies can sometimes work on Lyme also.  It could mean you have a weird strain. <br/>  <br/> Just some random ideas. Since we do not know your history  or have the information you do  you will have to see what is most likely here. <br/>  <br/> Dan,28,15,0.056737589,Training,Training

3668.241893,yes,yes,1572,86852,13,0,0,0,Since last july when I woke up one day dizzy with balance issues my life has not been the same. I have so many symptoms that people think I'm a hypochondriac. If someone could relate to my symptoms and at least relate to me I would probably be less upset.  I can't tell you how many times I'v e thought about going to the emergency room. I was not diagnosed with lyme until Jan 6 2009  almost 6 months after my first symptom. I had a low grade fever in Sept for 17 days 5 of which I spent in a hospital. I went on doxycyclene for 30 days  twice a day that ended on feb 6. I have no improvement and to be honest I feel worse. Recently I started getting headaches and sometimes I wake up with buzzing in my ears at night. My right foot is partially numb most of the day and I've been getting cold feelings on my head and legs sporadically throughout the day. I have a pain in my ribs on the right side that come and go along with a nauseous feeling. My left hand goes partially numb from time to time as well as my right. Sometimes my left arm is killing me also. Pins and needles on my face  arms and legs. All these symptoms come and go but I never feel 100%. Just recently my feet have muscle twitches on and off throughout the day. I'm scheduled for a spinal tap next week. Anybody else fell at least some of the things I do? What do I do? My infectious disease Dr basically said I was done with him after the doxycyclene  he didn't even schedule me for a follow-up. He said it might take months for the antibiotics to kick in.

It has also affected my hormones causing constant menstruation. I have told my LLMD of this information but need to find out more because I do not want to stop my meds unnecessarily. My respiratory systems is badly affected as I have Lyme  Babesia  Ehrlichia & Bartonella. If I can avoid stopping any meds then I wish to.

Makes one feel a little less alone in all this. I have been ill for 8 plus years. First it looked like just terrible pain from car wrecks then the fatigue then the fibro then brain fog depression and on and on.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> We caught Hashimotos that took the doc's just 10 years to find after my constant complaining.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> We tested for Mold yes  msh 8 c3a very high. Did Shoemakers but did not help. I am on lots of pain meds and sleeping aids. I did Lyme test Negative.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> But  after 3 different practioners tested me via EDS with Lyme  I decided its time to treat. I have so many of the symptoms with out any memory of being bit. I am treating with a ND using herbs and homeopathy.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I did a Metylation test with my MD and 12 out of 13 things tested were out of range. I don't know what to do with the info. She told me that I should take Gultathine mine was 3.1 range 3.8-5.5 and my Gultathoine oxidised was high .58 range .16-.50.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> My folic (RBC) was really low 337 range 16.8-21.4. She also advised taking FloPro. I really don't know what to do with this new info. From what I have read here and a bit on Konynenburgs site you want to fix the cycle not just take Gulatathoine.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I did a myers cocktail with a Gultathoine push last week. I felt a little better for a couple of days. But  then it was gone and I can't really afford to take these all the time. <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  I just don't know how important this is....if I should add one more long series of supplements......or if I am just wasting precious money on one more thing?  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Seems if I am to bother with it at all I should at least do the short 5 Konynenburg deal.

I picked them off & did not remember to check my self when I got home. <br/>   <br/> -          November ?07- became very tired.  I used to work out 5 days a week & take on larger house projects.  I would come home from work & lay on the couch.  I forced my self to start working out again & by the end of Nov I thought I pulled a muscle between my right shoulder blade & spine. <br/>   <br/> -          December ?07- the tightness in my rear should became much worse & I had shooting pains down my right arm & up my neck.  My primary doctor told me to see a chiropractor (I did not) <br/>   <br/> -          Jan?08- I had an upper respitory infection & since my wife was 8 months pregnant my doctor gave me Levaquin & soon learned what a herxheimer reaction was without knowing I had Lyme.  I told my doctor what was going on & he had me come in for a blood test.  By the end of the month I was diagnosed w/ Lyme & given 2 months of doxycycliene (Feb & Mar ?08). <br/>   <br/> -          After the 2 months of doxy my primary doctor stopped the antibx & I went down hill fast w/ fatigue & really bad brain fog.  I saw 2 infectious disease doctors & a neurologist all claiming I did not have Lyme- or no longer had Lyme.  I had no treatment for 2 months (April & May ?08)- I even had a spinal tap when I started having memory loss. <br/>   <br/> -          June?08- I finally found Dr K in Madison CT & she put me on 5 months of biaxin & plaquenil.  I had to stop that due to stomach issues I?m now on my third month of doxycycliene. <br/>   <br/> -          September ?08- I found a natriopath who does the f-scan & Rife- which I think is getting me better. All my blood test show I only have Lyme- but the Fscan says I have Lyme  Erlichea & Bartonella (I still need to be scanned for babasea & microplasma) <br/>   <br/> -\tI no longer have memory loss  no more anxiety  the body aches are not as bad as they were- but are still there sometimes.  My biggest issues now are brain fog & fatigue.  My energy level is nowhere where it used to be.  As far as brainfog goes- it also is no where as bad as it used to be- in the mornings I?m not too bad- but it starts to get worse by mid morning and continues to get worse & peaks around 4-6 PM and then lets off again around 8-9PM.  This is really driving me crazy- it is hard to work & the worse part is that I want to enjoy my first child/ new daughter & instead this has happened. <br/>  <br/> Symptoms <br/>  <br/> -\tDoes the brain fog ever go 100% away?  Does your stamina ever go back to what it was?

3713.406175,yes,yes,2143,69308,2,0,0,0,Hi there  <br/> I'm unsure where to start so I think I'll just explain my health problems briefly and please let me know what you think.  I'm 41 and female  have always been fit and active.  I've lived in the mountains of Virginia for the past 2-3 years.  This winter however I seem to be getting ever more decrepit at an alarming pace!  My health problems are: hypothyroidism  but it's mild so treated with the lowest dose of medication.  I've had carpal tunnel in one wrist (from falling down on a mountain trail) for 2 years but that was always v. mild but this winter has really  severely gone downhill  ha! bad joke.  And my family Dr. recently informed me that my knee aches & pains are patello femoral syndrome  aka runner's knee.  This also came on very suddenly.  What else?  Muscle or nerve(?) spasms that come and go  also recent.  So it seems that my health issues can be explained by general wear & tear  years of ballet (bad for knees)  etc  etc.  But each year since living in VA I've had one or two tick bites  i.e. having to pry them off and not knowing how long they were on me.  2008 was particularly bad for ticks in this area.  My husband and I and the dog all had the various different kinds on us at some point.  I know that not all ticks transmit Lyme disease.  Is it possible to have mild Lyme disease?  I feel kind of rough but those of you who have suffered from Lyme  were you a lot sicker?  i.e. sleeping huge amounts  and with a lot more problems than I currently have?  I can't remember any typical bulls-eye rashes but one bite site on the side of my knee caused localised pain that lasted for many weeks on and off.  My Dr. doesn't seem at all concerned about the various tick bites I've had and mentioned that the tick bite can cause localised pain afterwards without the transmission of any disease. I can't remember having any fevers.  My temp is usually a bit on the low side due to the thyroid problem probably. So I often think of all these logical reasons to account for my aches & pains but then the memory of those tick bites lurk in the back of my mind too.  Any opinions would be v. welcome  thanks!,13,199,0.0025,Training,Training

I was eighteen and too naive to question the nurse when she said it was a spider bite and sent me home with a sample of some kind of cream. Within six months i was searching for an answer for the horrible joint pain i was experiencing. That's not the half of my symptoms  just the beginning  but i wont get into all that. <br/>  <br/> I am on bicilin injections now and also am taking zithromax  malarone  synthroid and b-12 injections. <br/>  <br/> Over the years I have experienced heart palpitations occasionally. Recently  I have been having more occurances of not only palpitations but also pain on the side of my neck  lightheadedness  shortness of breath especially when i lay down  pain and tightness in my chest  a clicking or popping noise coming from my chest  fast heart beat  and while all this is happening my hands and finger start tingling like they are going numb. <br/>  <br/> My regular care physician who knows little about lyme disease  seems to think it may be mitral valve prolapse after making me wear a holter monitor for 24 hours (fun) and wants to schedule me for a doppler. Whatever that is. <br/>  <br/> Has anyone else experienced these problems with there heart? <br/>  <br/> Should I not worry about?  <br/>  <br/> Will the antibiotics fix this problem? <br/>  <br/> Or should I start looking for a cardiologist.  <br/>  <br/> Aghhhh!!!

I know have the task of finding an IV homecare agency  a place to have a PICC line inserted  fight with insurance to cover all of this as well as get my doctor to help me apply for TDI in RI for a short time. All while taking care of 2 small children. I am overwhelmed! If anyone out there is from RI and can point me in the right direction please IM me. I would be greatful for any assistance.

Likely also infected w/ lyme  bart  mycoplasma.  <br/>  <br/> After only two weeks of treatment I got yeast!! I was taking 6-7 PB8 probiotics daily. <br/>  <br/> My symptoms include bloating  abdominal pain  gas  burning and itching in all nether regions  burning eyes and nose  popping ears  burning mouth  coated tongue  fatigue and neuropathy.   <br/>  <br/> Prior to beginning abx  I actually felt pretty good  having done a lot in the way of diet and supplements. <br/>  <br/> I stopped my abx and am now on diflucan  to follow up with Nystatin.  I use milk thistle and do the lemon/olive oil drink nightly. <br/>    <br/> I've started the anti-yeast diet  joy!  But if it helps  so be it.  <br/>  <br/> I'm really freaking out.  How in the world do you stay on abx and control yeast??!! <br/>  <br/> I'll do plenty of searching here for tips  but I'm in need of any support or ideas anyone is able to offer. <br/>  <br/> Thank you! <br/>   <br/>   [ 05-10-2009  08:26 PM: Message edited by: Saskat ] ,23,8,0.100502513,Training,Training
3836.876524,yes,yes,1293,21110,3,0,0,0,I went camping 2 weeks ago and got bit on my arm by what I thought was a mosquito.  It looked just like any regular itchy bite would  but a couple days ago it turned into a slightly raised red bullseye.  Yesterday the bullseye turned yellow in color and there was a light red ring around it.  Today the light red ring is huge and the bullseye is still there.  You can't feel the rings around the bullseye that you could before  but the skin is kinda tough and its sooooo itchy and burns.   <br/>  <br/> My arm is sore from the shoulder down to my fingers and I'm feeling tired but do not have a fever or vomiting or anything.  I do feel a little weak  but could be bc I'm tired.   <br/>  <br/> I went to the docs yesterday and he doesn't think it's Lyme Disease.  He seems to think that I was bit and I'm having an allergic reaction to the venom of whatever bit me.  He did give me the antibiotic Ceftin to take for 2 weeks just incase.  I do feel kinda  weird  but don't want to jump to the conclusion that I have LD.  I have no other symptoms.  Does the bullseye rash ALWAYS mean Lyme Disease??  Could it be possible that I'm just having an allergic reaction?  Should I ask the doctor to be on antibiotics for longer than 2 weeks to be on the safe side??

I am trying to determine if i need to be screened for lyme  and i thought that someone might have some feedback for me.  <br/>  <br/> I should give some background. If any of this is not relevant or does not make sense  i apologize. Up until now  myself and my doctor(s) have been crediting my symptoms to problems with my reproductive system. I had a cyst rupture on an ovary  and ended up having surgery to determine whether or not i have endometirosis. A small amount of endo scar tissue was removed  as well as some small ovarian cysts as well. <br/>  <br/> I have continued to have symptoms since all of that  however  and there are other symptoms as well  that have caused me to wonder if lyme is a possible or additional cause of all these problems.  <br/>  <br/> Ok  here are my major symptoms that are the most persistent and noticeable and interfere with my functionality..( Note: many of these do manifest or get especially nasty when i menstruate) <br/>  <br/> -chronic nausea / vomiting (This one has been really bad for the last year  there have been sections of time where i vomit at least twice a week.) <br/> -abdominal pain <br/> -back and neck pain  especially right between my shoulders at the base of my neck as well as lower back <br/> -fatigue <br/> -depression/anxiety  sometimes severe <br/> -extreme moodiness  rapidly shifting moods <br/> -difficulty focussing on and completing tasks  especially multiple ones <br/> -frequent and easy bruising  <br/>  <br/> Does that sound familiar?

My story is that I was tested positive for the disease about 8 years ago. When first diagnosed  I was only given a 10 day supply of Prednisone. I did not understand the disease but in my mind I thought this had taken care of the problem  since my Dr. never educated me about it  or ever mentioned it to me again. I did question it myself  but just had faith in my Dr. at the time  that he knew what he was doing. Anyways  I have been on anti-anxiety meds for about 14 years and am now experiencing alot of arthritic pain  lower back pain and chronic fatigue  that has now lead me to the possibility this is the  key . If it were not for a good friend of mine  I would not be directed here. Anyways  this is my story  and looking for answers and relief! Sincerely  Fran,7,85,0.005813953,Training,Training

3896.935575,yes,yes,936,48023,4,0,0,0,Hello  I have just started treatment of doxycycline tabs 100mg per day and I usually am on the nuva ring ( like oral contraceptives yet it's a ring that you insert and leave in for 3 weeks and it's absorbed thru the skin). <br/>  <br/> Antibx affect oral contraceptives and I have found that they affect the nuva ring too. <br/>  <br/> The main reason I am on the nuva ring is because I get such bad cramps and a week long period.  I don't want to waste using the nuva ring if I am going to get spotting and cramps and a regular period and cramps anyway.   <br/>  <br/> Normally I would replace the nuva ring every three weeks so I wouldn't get a period at all.  Then after about 3 months of doing that I would leave it out for a week and I would have a mild period. <br/>  <br/> Does anyone have any experience with this or any suggestions? <br/>  <br/> I am miserable enough without a week of cramps once a month! <br/>  <br/> Thanks!,5,12,0.066666667,Training,Training

I would suggest going to an LLMD (Lyme Literate Medical Doctor) if you feel that there is something really wrong. Regular docs just don't have the capacity to really diagnose Lyme  I know  I went 12 years until they found it for me. <br/>  <br/> It is better to know so that you can start treatment. It may take awhile to get into an LLMD  so I would call very soon.

4015.884351,yes,yes,1924,62369,2,0,0,0,Hello all  <br/>  <br/> When I was 18  4 years ago  I was diagnosed with Lyme's disease after being mis diagnosed originally.   <br/>  <br/> Because the test was originally a false negative  I was lead to believe there wasn't a problem  and the disease was allowed to go un treated for quite a few months.   <br/>  <br/> After a second look into what was wrong with me  they took more blood  and I was told this time what was wrong.   <br/>  <br/> I was prescribed antibiotics for 2 to 3 weeks if I remember correctly.   <br/>  <br/> I finished them  and seemed to go back to normal and thought all was well.   <br/>  <br/> I lost 60 pounds in the span of just a few months.   <br/>  <br/> About 2 years ago I started getting joint pains  fatigue  and I developed a rash on my hands.   <br/>  <br/> I went to the doctor about the rash  but did not link the two  and didn't really know at the time that Lymes could be showing itself again with the joint pain.   <br/>  <br/> I was prescribed  again  by a different doctor  the incorrect medication for my hands  as I still have the skin problem.   <br/>  <br/> I am now 22  and the last few months have gotten un bearable with the pain.   <br/>  <br/> I am not able to walk down stairs without lifting my body on the railings  I cannot run  when I sit  I feel spiking pains in differnet parts of my legs and arms  and I limp on the left leg terribly.   <br/>  <br/> I believe I need to see a specialist  because normal doctors have dropped the ball time and time again with this disease  but I'm not sure exactly who I should be looking to see.   <br/>  <br/> Should I be looking towards a doctor who specializes in bone and joint problems?   <br/>  <br/> Is it going to be too late for me to fully recover  or is their still a chance to make a full recovery after treatment? <br/>  <br/> Thank you all. <br/>   <br/>   [ 02-23-2009  12:31 AM: Message edited by: Jersey5.0 ] ,6,9,0.08913649,Training,Training
4017.937709,yes,yes,1574,19775,7,0,0,0,My wife just got diagnosed with lyme a week ago.  We've concluded she's in the late stage.   <br/>  <br/> About 11 months ago she had bad headaches that we had checked out and were attributed to sinus issues (had an MRI done  etc.)  They went away with sinus treatment.  Though looking back  those could have been her first symptoms of lyme. <br/>  <br/> About 2 weeks ago her knee swelled and about 1.5 weeks later after a bunch of doctor visits they did a lyme test and it came back positive. <br/>  <br/> I'm just curious what some people with experiene can tell us about what to expect going forward  especially symptom wise.   <br/>  <br/> She has never shown any other signs other than what I stated above; no fatigue  nothing other than the headaches and swollen knee. <br/>  <br/> She has a 30 day script for Doxycycline  and her Primary Care (who is not a LLMD) wants to see her again in the last week of the script  probably to give her more (he said that). <br/>  <br/> We are looking for a LLMD and probably will be contacting one in the next few days. <br/>  <br/> The Local Health Dept. called to register her case  the woman whom my wife talked to seemed pretty knowledgeable and gave us a LLMD's name  she also said that my wife was in the  Late Stages  but also said that the good news was her  Levels were low .  My wife didn't ask enough questions and neither of us know what was meant by that.  I can only assume she meant the antibodies to the lyme.

4046.096644,yes,yes,2001,79197,11,0,0,0,Hi guys  <br/>  <br/> My brain is not working  and I am fighting panic about it.  I have a question  but I am struggling to compose it with enough but not TMI. <br/>  <br/> I have a cool  obviously lyme friendly doc who started me on doxy 150mg 2x/day a week ago on suspicion of neuro lyme.  My WB came back reactive only to band 41. <br/>  <br/> I have been pretty sick for the past month  I think I may be worse now (herx?) but I'm not sure if I am or if it's just more of the same.  I had an episode like this last October  and was unable to drive or participate in life much for about 2 months.  Then it lifted  and we thought it was because of the bio-identical hormones the doc started me on. <br/>  <br/> Okay  here's my question: I think I want to see a LLMD.  My primary doc is super cool  but if this IS lyme  this doc (kind of) missed it the first time it surfaced  and maybe I would be best served by a lyme specialist. <br/>  <br/> Okay  now here is my question  really:  how do I go about getting one?  Lou sent me a list (thank you) of llmd's.  They are clustered in the DC area  which is about 3-4 hrs from me.   <br/>  <br/> Should I start calling the ones that are geographically closest to me  and see what happens?  Are all the llmd's on the list equally good?   <br/>  <br/> I feel like a five year old.  Can't think my way out of a paper bag  no problem-solving skills  can't remember my own symptoms/med history  can barely comprehend half the posts I read here.   <br/>  <br/> I'm scared.  I think I need to be in the care of somebody that can do some thinking for me (which is a scary thought in itself!).   <br/>  <br/> I know this sounds ridiculous  but can somebody propose a next step for me?  Not a comprehensive list of options  but just a simple logical next step in getting an llmd? <br/>  <br/> Thank you.  My heart goes out to all of you who suffer.  From reading your posts  I know how very fortunate I am in many ways  and how much worse it could be.  Hugs to you!,8,17,0.051413882,Training,Training

He has always had some troubles falling asleep like I do. But since we increased his Biaxin to the 1000mg dosage he has the worst insomnia and nightmares!  <br/>  <br/> He goes to bed then can't fall asleep for awhile. Then he wakes every night (for 2 weeks now) at 1:30am with a nightmare.  <br/>  <br/> Then he can't fall back to sleep for an hour or more. We have tried to watch tv  read a book and nothing works. Then he gets hungry and eats. <br/>  <br/> The both of us have to sleep all day to recover. It's made my fatigue worse and I can't function. <br/>  <br/> So the LLMD isn't in until Monday. I am thinking of backing him down to 750mg a day. He was ok at that dosage. Then call LLMD on Monday. <br/>  <br/> I wonder what else he can give him that works good? He has Mycoplasma too. I was really hoping this Biaxin would work for him! <br/>  <br/> Anyone else get this problem? Any advice? <br/>  <br/> Thanks!!,27,9,0.088235294,Training,Training

4117.364933,yes,yes,2529,93242,7,0,0,0,Hi  I am a new member from England hoping to receive some help and guidance from other members and experts. We have NO lyme Paediatricians in the UK  and are having to learn about Lyme mainly from the internet! <br/>  <br/> Our issue is that whilst our UK paediatrician (he has NO experience of Lyme himself) has received guidance for our son's treatment from a US Lyme Paediatrician  and has agreed to follow it  he has NOT taken the US doc's advice for treating our daughter as her symptoms are less convincing to him. We are now considering self treating her by buying drugs off the internet  which is a frightening prospect! However  WITHOUT a UK docs agreement to treat  we are totally on our own. <br/>  <br/> Both children's history as follows:  <br/> Our 5yr old son was bitten as a baby  we were given incorrect advice at time of bite by British medical profession and told to leave tick attached  cover with vaseline  and no abx prescribed. He has now been diagnosed with Lyme and Babesia with positive bloods from Igenex  iritis and neuro pyschiatric problems  among many other sypmtoms. He is receiving treatment now thankfully and is slowly improving. <br/>  <br/> My worry and questions relate to my 3yr old daughter. She has no history of tick attachment  however obviously same genetic make up and lifestyle/rural exposure. We recently had Igenex test results as follows for her: <br/> Western Blot IGM <br/> 31 IND <br/> 39 IND <br/> 41 ++ <br/>  <br/> Western Blot IGG <br/> 39 IND <br/> 41 +++ <br/> 45 ++ <br/>  <br/> Serum PCR <br/> Genomic Negative <br/> Plasmid Positive <br/> Positive confirmed by Southern Dot Blot <br/>  <br/> Babesia Fish RNA = Negative <br/> Babesia Duncani: <br/> IGM 1:20 Titer <br/> IGG 1:80 Titer <br/>  <br/> Her symptoms are mild and have only been noted by me since early October 2008. The most consistant being  dry cough  pale complexion and dark under eyes. Over Christmas she developed a rash that was mottled and spread up her right leg  down her left  then up her trunk  down her arms and finished by spreading across her cheeks and nose. She is off her food. On occasions she has mentioned her throat  leg and feet hurt. Frequently she complains of feeling sick  and has been on occasions  and generally she has become more irritable. <br/>  <br/> We desperately don't want her to get as sick as her brother  however  do not wish to treat her without UK medical help (or unnecessarily).  <br/>  <br/> What should we do? We would welcome any thoughts on this. Many thanks,2,12,0.072562358,Training,Training

4124.97218,yes,yes,1533,94167,1,0,0,0,I was diagnosed with Lyme within a few weeks of contracting it in 2005 and given 3 weeks of antibiotics. It was confirmed with a blood test at 6 weeks.   <br/>  <br/> I had all the flulike symptoms  fever  pains  and hubby said I looked like a Target advertisement with bullseye rashes all over my body (they only showed up in the evening for some reason). <br/>  <br/> I remember feeling better after the antibiotics  but I suspected problems when it took 6 months for all the pains to go away.  I also got pneumonia in that time period.   <br/>  <br/> A year after diagnosis I had a strange and sudden surge in allergies that took months to properly diagnose. <br/>  <br/> The biggest problem is ongoing fatigue and sleep problems.  I used to have winter depression that I took care of with noon walks and heartrate-pushing exercise on my excercise bike.  I now simply fight year round to feel normal and the walks and exercise don't cure it anymore. <br/>  <br/> The only testing that has really shown anything wrong is extremely low cortisol (I do not have Addison's).  All my CBC and hormonal testing has been consistently normal. <br/>  <br/> I am a health nut and work with a nutritionist.  With a diet void of sugar and white flour  I eat almost a perfect diet and maintain a normal weight.  I exercise everyday and take a large regimine of high quality vitamins. <br/>  <br/> Having been diagnosed and treated that early  could Lyme possibly be the culprit or am I on a wild goose chase here? <br/>  <br/> Thanks so much.   ,4,15,0.058608059,Training,Training

4146.253925,yes,yes,2353,90353,26,0,0,0,Hi. First a little background: I started having weird symptoms in the Spring of 2000. I put myself into a constant state of panic thinking  <br/>  <br/> I had all these horrible diseases (MS  ALS). Some of the symptoms were muscle twitching  a feeling like my foot was asleep and I couldn't wake it up  hot sensations on the tops of my thighs  and several other little things that I can't even remember.  <br/>  <br/> In early 2001  I found an LLMD in Alabama and got tested. It was positive. I was on Zithromax and Flagyl from April-December. But I never really got sick.  <br/>  <br/> Th dr. even commented on that....why I didn't get sick  both before and during abx tx. I never felt bad and did all my usualy workouts during that time. Anyway  by the end of tx  most  if not all the stuff was gone. <br/>  <br/>  Throughout these last 8 years  I've had some of the same little things come and go  but never stay more than a week  if that. I even went back to him at one point to talk about it and he said he didn't think it was Lyme. <br/>  <br/> Now to the present: On Feb 8th  after my morning shower  I notced that my scalp felt more sensitive; not painful  just maybe slightly burning and just more sensitive. <br/>  <br/>  That night  it went into my face and felt like I had gotten some sun  which I hadn't. These feelings come and go  sometimes no scalp or face involvement  sometimes both  sometimes the cheeks  sometimes the lips  and so on.  <br/>  <br/> No rash. No itching. Over the past year or so  I've noticed that sometimes it seems like I can't type well  meaning I easily mispell words...or will be thinking 2 words in sentence but type one of the words twice...and then sometimes I get tongue tied.  <br/>  <br/> SOOOOOO.. could this be Lyme still??? I had convinced myself earlier today it was MS. Oh  back at the beginning of all this  I had a brain MRI which was normal.  <br/>  <br/> I've had MRI's of the spine since then due to a herniated disc and nothing was said about MS lesions  though I'm not sure if they went up any further than the lumbat area.  <br/>  <br/> The only reason I haven't already gone back to see the dr is $$$. I'm trying to get some credit cards paid off and I don't want the added debt. Thoughts?  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Also  to answer a few questions  I did see an LLMD and was on 2 abx for 9 months.,5,17,0.051918736,Training,Training

4154.140058,yes,yes,1913,14296,3,0,0,0,Hi all.   <br/>  <br/> I recently found this site after someone told me that my symptoms could be related to lyme disease.  I did a little internet investigating  and here I am. <br/>  <br/> I've been having random shooting nerve pain for almost 2 years now.  It came on after a I had some pretty strong flu-like symptoms one weekend...aches  chills  fever  etc. The shooting nerve pains has gotten much worse over the last 6-8 months. The pain is not constantly there  but comes randomly  anywhere on my body and last just a few seconds. But  when it comes  it is sometimes very intense and sends a wave through my entire body. Overall  I have some days where I experience over 30 zaps in a day  maybe more. They almost feel electrical in nature. Also  when I'm active and/or busy  they are much less frequent. A couple more things...i get them while sleeping (but more so upon first waking up) and they are much more frequent after lunch. My job involves sitting at the desk for extended periods  which is the time when I seem to notice them more. <br/>  <br/> I have talked with doctor about it who eventually referred me to a neurologist. The neuro really didn't know what it was. They decided to do a brain MRI and other tests  which all came back normal. <br/>  <br/> Overall  i'm a healthy guy  30 years old  6'3  210 lbs. I played collegiate basketball and played professionally in Europe. I continue exercising to this day. My body feels okay  otherwise. I don't have any muscle weakness or anything like that.  I do have aches frequently in my lower back and I also get headaches quite frequently. <br/>  <br/> Other medical issues: I have had twitching in eyelids and other places in body. My only other condition that may have a relation is that I suffer from acid-reflux.

4164.393457,yes,yes,4514,9883,9,0,0,0,First of all hello my name is Matt  I'm from Kentucky  and I'm new to the forum.  I have come in in search of some answers to my current situation.  I apologize if this gets lengthy  I'll try to keep it short.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> In a nutshell I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2 days though my symptoms didn't start until being bit by a deer fly which can carry Lyme's disease.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> To start I am an active healthy 24 year old male with no diseases or health problems (that I know of) and not on any medications.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> So I work for the city and I am outside all day every day.  Monday  June 1st 2009 I had a bothersome deer fly buzzing around while I was mowing.  So I look down and he was sucking the blood from my left forearm.  I gave him a smack and went on about my business.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The next day (Tuesday) I go to work and notice that I have a golfball sized swelling under the bite location.  I also noticed a couple of small reddish brown spots on the inside of my elbow joint (same arm  about 6-8  from the bite) that were not there before.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> So all was well until Wednesday.  Everything was fine and when I left home to go back to work after lunch I felt very sluggish and uncoordinated.  My boots felt very heavy and I seemed  out of it.   I continued to work and the symptoms somewhat went away until around 7:00 that night.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The feelings came back twice as bad as before.   Very sickly feeling with confusion and the right side of my body began to feel like it was shutting down.  Tingling right side of face/lips  weak arm and leg  and poor motor skills.  I took an advil and went to bed hoping it would go away.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Well when I awoke  it was still there.  I had trouble telling my arm/hand what I wanted it to do as well as my foot/leg which made walking difficult.  I went to the doctor and he did a blood test and ordered a CT scan.  He also noticed my right side/shoulder  slumping.    <br/>  <br/>  <br/> So the blood test came back negative and I went to have the ct scan with contrast done on my brain.  It came back that I had 2  spots  one on the left and one on the right.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The doctor assumed that I had a mild stroke.  Crazy to hear at 24 years old.  Anyway he ordered an MRI the next day to confirm.  So I take the MRI with contrast as well and wait for the results.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> My regular doctor went on vacation and handed my case over to another doctor.  They call me and said that those 2  spots  are lesions of white matter on my brain.  They proceed to tell me that they have set up an appointment to see a neurologist  and that they think I have multiple sclerosis.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I went to see the neurologist which was very shady considering he was in a little shanty office using a school desk.  He didn't even have the equipment to observe the MRI scans.  He held them up to a light bulb and says  Yep looks like you have MS.   He proceeds to tell me that he's writing a prescription for steroids and Rebif so I could take shots every other day for my  MS.   He wanted me to start immediately.  It was like a punch in the face.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I tried to start taking the steroids to help my right side but they made me feel terrible.  Extreme back and leg pain as well as nausea and disorientation.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> So I'm a little weary about them coming to these conclusions in 2 days time.  Especially when he said  I'll schedule for you to have a spinal tap but it doesn't matter because if it comes back positive or negative  you still have MS.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Saturday my right side functions seems to have return and I have since gone back to work.  I have been doing research on Lyme's Disease and my symptoms are very consistant with it.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I am seeing a NEW doctor Saturday which has seen Lyme's cases before to have some tests run to see if that what it is.  I also have another appointment scheduled for the 15th of July with another neurologist to get a second opinion on this multiple sclerosis.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I'm not in denial it just seems like I was diagnosed really fast without having tests to rule out possible Lyme's disease.  The last thing I want is to give myself shots to treat something I may not even have.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Thanks again and sorry that my story is so long       <br/>   <br/>   [ 06-17-2009  11:57 AM: Message edited by: mtm ] ,41,14,0.062426384,Training,Training

I am so sick and just wondering if this is enough of a dose until I see the LLMD.   <br/>  <br/> I think I'm herxing but it's hard to tell because I was so bad before I started this dose a couple days ago.  Any thoughts?   <br/>  <br/> I guess it just scares me how sick I am and I'm really concerned if I'm being treated enough right now.  <br/>  <br/> I just don't want even 2 weeks to go by and somehow get worse.  I'm sure this dose is better than nothing because I was going with nothing for months BUT I'm still concerned.   <br/>  <br/> I'm a tall gal but skinny...5'10  and 150lbs.

Almost normal. <br/>  <br/> Then  about a week ago  I woke up one day and had horrible nausea. I didn't think much of it because nausea was one on my original symptoms and it makes an appearance every now and then. <br/>  <br/> But  the nausea has not gone away and is unrelenting. It is so bad I am vomitting once or twice a day. Plus  my stomach just seems generally upset all the time. <br/>  <br/> And now  I have vertigo! I woke up yesterday with it and its here with me again today. The room feels like it is spinning. <br/>  <br/> Are these side effects of plaquenil? Will they go away?  <br/>  <br/> I am also taking mepron  zith  and omnicef.

4302.645933,yes,yes,3008,55500,8,0,0,0,Hi  <br/>  <br/> I lived in Colorado for a year back in 2000  and since returning to the UK I have suffered from certain neurological intermittent issues such as slurred speech  dizzyness / disorientation  word-finding problems - I have since had it diagnosed as a peculiar type of migraine. <br/>  <br/> More recently  I have been presenting a whole myriad of problems that are really starting to concern me. <br/>  <br/> 18 months ago  I started getting pains and discomfort around the inside edge of my shoulder blades. I thought it to be muscle strain. <br/>  <br/> Then  14months ago  I started getting severe clicks in my hip joints  with considerable pain. <br/>  <br/> Shortly after  my shoulder joints started clicking and aching. <br/>  <br/> Then other joints joined on the bandwagon - always with clicks when moved  and aching - jaw joint  neck joint  wrists  ankles  knees - although knees where not too agrivated. <br/>  <br/> At this time (14months ago) I started inquiring with the doctor - had tests for arthritis and all arthritic/inflamatory indicators came back showing normal. I was also tested for low testosterone  which also came back normal. <br/>  <br/> More recently (just after Christmas)  and of special concern to me  my chest has started causing me a lot of pain. Generally  I will be sat down (due to my aching joints lol - sorry - don't know if humour allowed)  and completely out of the blue I will have a momentary pain on the left side of my chest  just at the bottom of my diaphram  and will have an instantaneous surge of adrenalin - I will involuntarily sit up and breathe in - some shock. Afterwards  generally shakey and tired. I also feel like I need to cough to clear my airways (even though technically clear) and feel breathless (though unlike after exercise - more sense of not having enough oxygen). I then get dull aches on the top part of my left chest area  just above my nipple  and can feel tender. <br/>  <br/> My doctor thinks it could be Bornholm Disease  but really doesn't seem to fit at all with my other systemic symptoms. <br/>  <br/> I insisted on being tested for Lyme Disease after hearing a report on the news of a woman who had similar symptoms to mine (though I can not remember ever being bitten or any bite marks / bulls eyes). My doctor reluctantly put me in for a test  'Borrelia C6 Peptide EIA' and my results were negative. <br/>  <br/> I'm totally clutching at straws  and my doctor doesn't know what to tell me apart from prescribing anti inflamatory tablets. <br/>  <br/> Anyone got any advice? Do my symptoms fit with Lyme? Any contacts in the UK that I might try (did try googleing but nothing substantial came up for the UK). <br/>  <br/> Bit desperate  though trying to smile! <br/> Thanks! <br/> John <br/>  <br/>  <br/> [Apologies - posted same message in General Support - but only afterwards realised was probably best in Medical Questions - SORRY      ] <br/>   <br/>   [ 03-07-2009  02:03 PM: Message edited by: John Fin ] ,12,14,0.062857143,Training,Training

A few hours later I couldn't sleep anymore  the spot where the tick had bitten me had become swollen and infected.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> My parrents came and took me to the hospital. I had some bad luck because the doctor wasn't there right then so the asistant decided to do something before the infection spread any further.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> It was pretty big by then  I could feel it  that part was 1 inch higher than the rest of my head and it hurt.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The asistant cut it open and cleaned it  gave me some pills and I came a week later for another check up. I thought it was the end of the story then. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The past five years I've been trying to find out why I feel so tired  why I can't concentrate anymore and my cognitive abilities are getting worse by each passing day.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I have bladder problems  anxiety  my back hurts  my knees hurt and my muscles twitch uncontrolably when I'm under stress especially my neck muscles and my hands.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I can't stand being arround many people that I don't know  also I can't talk well when I'm under stress.  <br/>  <br/> In my family everyone talks a lot  they have no constraint whatsoever when taking to people they have never met.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I can't bear it  I avoid talking like the plague  it's like something instantly lodges in my neck and my voice changes like I'm afraid  I start twitching and sweating.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> As you'd imagine I don't have a lot of friends because of it altough I try my best to be sociable and not seem too wierd. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> It's been killing me for the past 2 years  I feel the need to sleep all the time  I'm never relaxed  my concentration and memory are getting worse  my grades in school have dropped from a 9-10 level to 5-6 level.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I can't learn anymore and I have a graduation exam coming in a month  I don't think I'll fail but neither will I do any good  and then there's the college exam.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I know there's no one shot  one day cure but what can I do ? I'm just so depressed and in pain. <br/>  <br/> I've been to doctors but they don't seem to think its serious  most just said I should get more exercise or stuff like that and a few gave me supliments like vitamins and magnesium.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I exercise  I take vitamins  supliments and nothing  no relief  I'm tired and fatigued.

Only a tiny bit of mold in sight  but it tested severe for Aspergillus NIger.  My son was treated for mold along with Lyme.  IT has trigger severe chemical sensitivities in both of us now.  Horrible.  We have moved  but had to throw everything that I could. <br/>  <br/> It has been very difficult finding concrete information as to how to kill the toxins on our things.  I have thrown almost everything we own  washed what I could (after researching the best method)  but when it  comes down to paper items or photos  I cannot find a way to decontaminate these items.  Has anyone heard of a way to kill the Asper. Niger toxins on paper?   <br/>  <br/> Does anyone know of anyone to write or call that would know this?  The EPA did not know...  I get vauge answers from other places that I have contacted.  Seems like the info. is more geared towards mold that you can see like in bathrooms or under sinks. <br/>  <br/> For my son's recovery and to not contaminate our current home  I have to make sure everything is clear of the toxins.  Until then  I have bundled up the last of our things that would be very hard to dispose of and have them stored in the garage. <br/>  <br/> I am hoping that someone has a lead for me....Thanks!,9,27,0.03187251,Training,Training
4457.940552,yes,yes,2311,22217,4,0,0,0,I am taking my 2 year old to see the doctor in CT. I took a tick off of him and it was positive for Ehrlichia.  Hope to have caught it early. Hope to stop it with antibiotics and happy to see a doctor who i know will treat him correctly. <br/>  <br/> On the flip side  I have a four old who has been sick with other health issues and for him we go to an infectious disease doctor. She has been so helpful with his issues  which are completely separate from my 2 year old. His symptoms are different and are not lyme. But she has been a respected medical professional for us for the past few years for my 4 year old and his issues. And for that i am thankful.  <br/>  <br/> However  on a recent visit with the infectious disease doctor for my four year old  my husband mentioned what was going on with my 2 year old. He only mentioned Ehrlichia and how we had the tick tested by igenex. She informed us that the lab was  quackery . She told us that she doesn't believe these labs that are not FDA approved. And some of these labs will put a positive Lymes diagnosis on every tick. She also asked me that if the lab was so great  why didn't they tell me what strain of ehrlichia was in the tick.  <br/>  <br/> I am new to this whole process and my knowledge is limited in lymes. I had no rebuttal. I know igenex is not quackory.  What do you say to naysayer?s? Why is igenex not an FDA approved lab?  <br/>  <br/> Yes  i respect this doctor for the fabulous works she has done with my four year old who was very sick himself. But it was something other than lymes. But i was very upset about this conversation we had about lymes. <br/>  <br/> She told me if it was her child  she would just wait and see. I obviously am not going to wait and see but the conversation was so upsetting  i can't get it out of my head. <br/>  <br/> I am not listening to her on this topic. I am not bringing it up again to her and i am not going to tell her about my visit with the ped dr in CT.  <br/>  <br/> But quackery? Come on?  <br/>  <br/> But after my long story and venting  i guess my only question is about Igenex. <br/> Why is igenex not FDA approved? Are there other labs as accurate as Igenex that are FDA approved? <br/>  <br/> My hope is that everyone in the medical community will open their eyes an all become LLMD.,16,21,0.041575492,Training,Training

If there is any glare around me when I'm trying to look at something  I'm unable to focus on whatever I'm looking at.  <br/>  <br/> I went to the optometrist  and all she could find was that I had very slight astigmatism (+.25 and -.25).  <br/>  <br/> Apparently  many people have this  and never get symptoms. Well  since then  my vision has detoriorated even more  in ways that do not relate to astigmatism.  <br/>  <br/> I get occasional blurry spots  and (this is going to sound weird  but...) I can see my nose all the time. <br/>  <br/>  It feels almost the same as when you go cross-eye  but not as extreme  and it just happens on its own.  <br/>  <br/> I can see sort of a shadow of my nose in the centre of my vision  and if I look to the side or down  it gets worse and I get double vision.  <br/>  <br/> If I look up  I just get a blind spots in a line along the centre of my vision (where my nose used to be).  <br/>  <br/> I also find I have a hard time looking up- even just looking straight in front of me (like when I drive) makes my eyes tired really quickly.  <br/>  <br/> It's not double vision (I only see one of everything)  but there is definitely something weird going on... <br/>  <br/> And it doesn't helop that my eyes are super puffy and twitchy either.. <br/>  <br/> Anyway  the speed at which this is progressing is making me nervous. All this has happened in 3-4 weeks  but the last 2 weeks have had the greatest change.  <br/>  <br/> Has anyone had similar symptoms? Did they happen this quickly as well?  <br/>  <br/> I'm also curious about the astigmatism thing  since I had more-than-perfect vision prior to this.  <br/>  <br/> Was anyone else diagnosed with astigmatism when they got Lyme? <br/>  <br/> Cheers! <br/> Nicole <br/>   <br/>   [ 06-10-2009  12:10 PM: Message edited by: Nicole_Denise ] ,19,8,0.098253275,Training,Training

4567.77516,yes,yes,3441,96291,2,0,0,0,Hi Everyone  <br/> I am really struggling and need to share and get some feedback (if people can relate.)  I really want to get to a better place with my life and Lymes diesease. Thanks. <br/>  <br/> Background:  I have chronic lymes  have been ill for many many years.  Tried anything and everything to  cure it  spent mega-bucks traveling to different doctors  clinics  treatments  etc.  I Bought all the rife and other machines  etc.  Before and during getting sick I had a super career - which I worked very hard at and sacrificed much  -  and then had to leave and get SSD. <br/>  <br/> Pitfall #1 <br/>  <br/> Before Lymes I had always been able to overcome life?s challenges with prayer and perseverance.    I was a hard-driving type-A personality with faith that I could overcome anything with enough prayer and perseverance.   If I had difficulties in various areas of life I would just THROW myself at finding a solution.  It always paid off eventually?..EXCEPT WITH FINDING A CURE FOR MY LYMES. <br/>  <br/> So the painful and torturous battle with lymes really shot an arrow through my relationship with God  and  my positive life outlook.  The discouraging disappointments with hundreds of lymes treatments took the wind out of my spiritual sails. <br/>  <br/> I eventually had to start seeing the state of sickness as some sort of ?life Lesson ? instead something to find to fix  just for my sanity.    I couldn?t stand living in constant disappointment and futileness caused by repeated attempts to get cured.   <br/>  <br/> Eventually my previous positive and empowered belief in god disintegrated over time  due to feeling forsaken and unhelped by god. The loss of my positive relationship with god has been so painful.  Now I just have a lackluster relationship with god. <br/>  <br/> Is this something anyone can relate to? <br/>  <br/> Pitfall #2 <br/>  <br/> I have been in counseling in order to deal with my loss of career.  What has dramatically surfaced in the counseling is that my despair about my career-less life basically all stems from the toxic beliefs learned in childhood.  My father raised me to believe only one thing mattered in life:  HAVING A SUCCESSFUL CAREER.  People who didn?t work  like mothers  for instance  were judged as ?lazy loosers?.   His religion was career-worship  just like other people have idol-worship or money-worship. <br/>  <br/> My counselor keeps uncovering the extreme judgements that I was raised with; basically you either have a successful career or you are a looser.   <br/>  <br/> When I had my successful career this was all hidden.  But when I left my career due to lymes  I started having MAJOR problems with feeling unworthy  feeling like a looser  feeling life was meaningless  etc.  So all this toxic career-worship stuff came up in therapy. <br/>  <br/> After many years in therapy  we still keep uncovering deeper ways in which dad judged my worth by what jobs/achievements I had  and how that still comes up in my life. <br/>  <br/> So this is why I?ve struggled with feeling so unworthy and crappy about life without my career. <br/>  <br/> So  my job now is to ?re-brainwash? myself with positive messages about myself and life.  IT?S REALLY HARD!  It?s a major challenge for me to feel ok about myself being sick and not working.   <br/>  --------------------- <br/>  <br/> Well  those are my big struggles and I?m hoping folks can relate.

I am 23 dx'ed with MS in 2005 but I have not had a typical course of  MS  I suspect lyme for the past 15 years  though all tests have come back negative for lyme and co-infections...typical. <br/>  <br/> I am now seeing an LLMD in Mt. Kisco  Ny and being treated with 500mg 3x Daily Amoxicillin. I am 1 week into it and haven't noticed any change thus far.  <br/>  <br/> My main concern is my vision. I have chronic pars planitis  intermediate uveitis  and as a result have cystoid macular edema  retinal vasculitis and posterior uveitis. I have brain lesions and Oligoclonal banding as well as MBProtein in my spinal fluid (negative for lyme). SO as to not get too far into my long list of symptoms... <br/>  <br/> Has anyone been cured of their chronic uveitis after lyme treatment? I have been on steroid eye drops for 5 years now and I can no longer handle it (high intraocular pressure). I am slowly losing my vision to cystoid macular edema from the chronic inflammation and retinal leakage. Any help would be greatly appreciated. <br/>  <br/> If anyone can recommend a LLMD/Neuro-opthalmologist I would also appreciate it.  <br/>  <br/> CR,4,15,0.057142857,Training,Training

I have seen several docs and got every test you can think of. Its been told to me that I have an anxiety disorder but I cant accept that. After listing all of my symptoms  it was suggested I get checked out for Lyme Disease. I did the Lyme Disease symptom check list  and I checked 27 sypmtoms. I know you all are not doctors but I am at whitts end here. I know something is and has been wrong and noone can figure it out!

4639.322296,yes,yes,1753,55796,5,0,0,0,My daughter has been experiencing odd medical symptoms this past year.  All were passed off as some other ailment other than Lyme-   But when she had boils and blisters on her face that wouldn't quit  I sent her to a dermatologist near her college in Florida who put her on 100mg of Doxycycline for 3wks.  The face condition still did not clear up so I brought her to a hormonal Dr. who (without us knowing) tested her for Lyme-The Western Blot revealed 23 and 41 bands positive even though she was on antibotics.  As my daughter didn't  and doesn't want to drop out of college I brought her to a LLD (so I thought) near her college.  He immediately wanted to put her on IV Rocephin for 6wks   We both freaked because I almost died from Lyme 17yrs ago  and couldn't handle the IV and thought high oral doses would be more appropriate for a start.  The Dr did many other blood tests in a course of 3 wks. and decided she did not have any co-infections and after a  more recent test decided her Lyme had subsided and her symptoms were are now being caused by Herpes6 which keeps showing up positive.  He now wants her to maybe try an antiviral drug- I told the Dr that I had understood Herpes 6 just reactivates when you have Lyme but he said no- that it was in her DNA so it was a recent infection. She could have contracted it by kissing or from a baby she was babysiting. My gut tells me she still has Lyme  needs to get treated with high oral doses of antibotics and this Herpes6 is just reactivated.  <br/> Does anyone have any experience with this virus?  There is not a lot out there about it.  Her Dr said the virus was  on the cutting edge   Am I hopping on the Lyme Disease merry-go-round all over again?

I was recently put on homebound. <br/> I have yet to have any success with treatment so far <br/>  <br/> I was wondering if there is anyone who can speak from experience  on how to deal with the whole college thing while being too sick to function <br/>  <br/> I have always been a really good student  good athlete  involved in the community  and had my hopes set on top colleges. Now that I am too sick to tolerate as much as I had before and  with uncertainty of when this will all end  I wonder what is going to happen? <br/>  <br/> Education is such an important part of a persons life  and I do not want to have my dreams compromised as a result of Lyme. Because  I know when I am older and cured  I would regret not having the college experience I always wanted. <br/>  <br/> Nevertheless I am working on applications and will have to get out of touring the schools. I have been on oral abx. for about 3 months (tried a couple different things) and have had no luck. <br/>  <br/> Is it time to move on to another treatment? When will the meds. start working and this nightmare come to an end? Anybody have any relevant success stories? Or any good advice in general? <br/>  <br/> Sorry for such a long post...

I did live in conn. during the early years this disease was discovered so I am knowledgeable about it somewhat  and probably more frightened than most here. <br/>  <br/> Around the first week in March I became very fatigued. <br/> I was concerned that I may have blood suger issues  at 47 I am about the right age. <br/>  <br/> I visited my GP  test were run and nothing was found. <br/>  <br/> About a week or so later what had been a small red place under my arm continued to enlarge to about the size of a quarter  the center turned flesh colored and spread out. <br/>  <br/> I went to the internet already having a clue and upset  the only place I found a duplicate was under the CDC website and it was a Lymes rash. <br/>  <br/> I returned to the GP that was quite skeptical and begged her to go on the internet  she agreed to treat me with doxycyclene claiming the entire time that she did not beleive that it is Lymes  because they don't have Lymes in GA. <br/>  <br/> The Lyme titer was negative. <br/>  <br/> I improved somewhat after a 2 week course than went down very hard a week later  The symptoms were typical the worse being foot pain  tremors vision problems  and fatigue. <br/>  <br/> I returned to the Keiser group to another Dr. that informed me a negative titer meant I could not have it and ran some more labs  and sent me home empty handed. <br/>  <br/> Of course I worsened over the next week to the point I could not get out of the bed. <br/>  <br/> The set of test showed a slightly elevated WBC the next doctor claiming it could not be lymes put me on a broad spectrum antibiotic avalox  some of the nerve and joint pain was relieved by this. <br/>  <br/> The brain fog and vertigo continued to worsen to the point that as of the past week I have the sensation of being drunk  very drunk. <br/>  <br/> The avalox sent me to the emergency room with symptoms of hysteria from an overload to my nervous system that made jump out of my skin if touched  or from light and sounds. <br/>  <br/> I have had questions about my emotional statis from day one  the assumption that I am middle aged and depressed seeking some attention  I find this humiliating. <br/>  <br/> I was treated like a junky at the ER until the drug test came back normal  I also met skepticism about the lymes there. <br/>  <br/> My first question  <br/> They sent off a western blot test 3 weeks ago  does it normally take that long for it to come back? it still is not in? <br/>  <br/> Does anyone know of a Dr. in the Atlanta are that believes in the existence of this disease and would diagnose me? <br/>  <br/> I started treating myself with the salt and vit.C this morning  has anyone seen any improvement with this treatment. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> At this point I am truly concerned that I may die of this  or worse end up vegetable. <br/>  <br/> Thanks to anyone that can help with these questions. <br/> Laurie <br/>  <br/>  <br/> A brain tumor was rulled out on this vivsit,10,11,0.080724876,Training,Training
4708.726031,yes,yes,2372,24876,13,0,0,0,I randomly ran across something today that led me to this website  and I'm starting to wonder what's wrong with me.   <br/>  <br/> For over the past month  I have had many symptoms that COULD be related to Lyme.  About 7 weeks ago  I was walking our dog.  Later that evening  I got out of the shower and my wife noticed a tick on my side.  I live in SC by the way.  I got a bit scared  but felt fine for a couple days  so I thought it was over.  Then  the bite turned into a bump and got worse and itchy.  I started feeling a little weak.  I finally went to the doctor and he told me it couldn't be Lyme.  By then  I had been bitten one more time as well.  They did say that my white blood count was low normal and something else was low normal  damned if I can't remember what it was.  He gave me a topical steroid and told me it would clear it up.  I put that on for two weeks and it did nothing.  Then  3 weeks ago  I started getting bumps all over my thighs and lower back/upper butt.  These itched so bad I couldn't stand it.  I went back to the doctor  but he couldn't do a culture due to me scratching the tops off.  He did give me Doxycycline to take  thinking it was a bacterial infection.  He gave me 14 days of the pill  100mg each (substituted for Monodox).  I am in the middle of it  which is helping the itching and getting rid of the bumps slowly.  The bite/bump is still there and will not go away.   <br/>  <br/> I have no fever and actually feel ok otherwise.  The main problems are that I am very irritable  have slept fine but can't go back to bed after I wake up  and my memory sucks  quite frankly. I forget things that someone told me 2 minutes before and lose my train of thought during sentences sometimes.  IMPORTANT: I am going through the most stressful time of my life right now  having lost my father 10 months ago and am having great difficulties with my partner in my job.  So much that no one can imagine. I have a great deal of stress in my life right now.  I am 30 years old.  I would attribute the memory loss  moodiness  and lack of sleep to my stress and the 10 million things on my to do list lately before Lyme  but I thought it was worth mentioning.  Could anyone give me any advice?   <br/>  <br/> Did I miss anything?  I'm bald already  but have quite a bit of hair all over my body and am losing none  trust me!

4764.048851,yes,yes,8221,44192,4,0,0,0,Hi I'm 27 and live in Western Australia. Since March 2002 I have been having 'episodes' every 6 months. Usually between the Last 2 weeks of March through til the end of April.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Each episode starts with a general pain in all joints & muscles  sore throat and swollen glands. Within a couple of days the pain becomes worse and my joints and sometimes face begin to swell.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Within a week the pain from the top to bottom of my spine is unbearable and the pain in my joints is also extremely painful though it moves from joint to joint usually will have a knee  several fingers  elbow and ankle all sore at the same time and then the pain will jump to other joints.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Within a day or two of the pain commencing I will start getting hot and cold sweats day & night which get worse as the days go by  I?m either shivering or sweating.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The pain gets to the point where I feel like I need to throw up as it is that bad  by this point I'm extremely sensitive to light and sounds.???? <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Usually I will go to the hospital at this point as I can no longer keep down painkillers (not that they work anyway) and the doctors will give me a Lumbar Puncture to test for Meningitis or Meningococcal the tests (15 to date) are always negative. ??? <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Then they do the same tests they conduct every 6 months (everytime I have an ?episode?) Ross River  Glandular Fever  Lupus  Rheumatoid Arthritis  etc etc. The tests turn up no reasonable explanation for my symptoms so the doctors treat my symptoms til the episode is over or until I am able to leave hospital.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> That was until April 2008 when I had yet another ?episode? except this time I was taken to the biggest hospital in our state and seen by almost every specialist within the hospital.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The Infectious Disease resident was the first person in the 7 years I had been sick to ask me this question ?When was the last time you remember feeling healthy? he said  after a moments thought ?when I was in New York in 2001? then he probed on ?Did you do anything different  While you were in New York? this time I needed no thought on the matter. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ?Yes  I picked up a deer on the I95...Dad always taught me to get wildlife off the road even if Dead (the deer was alive so it was a bit of a task getting it off the road by myself)? I also added ?I don?t know if it means anything but when I told my girlfriends that I moved the deer the next day they all told me I was stupid and that I probably had Lyme Disease?.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> After this the doctor questioned what Lyme was I said I think it had something to do with Ticks and he said if he could find a test to test for it he would do just that. The next day they tested for it using the ELISA test and it came back positive for Lyme Serology.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> So they inserted a PIC line and once a day I went into hospital to receive my Ceftriaxone dose. This antibiotic therapy continued for 28 days. A week prior to the end of the therapy my doctor ordered a Western Blot test  which was completed and sent away to some special place on the east coast and it came back negative a week later.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ?? By the time the results came back from the Western Blot I had one more day of treatment and the Infectious Disease Doctor said I would no longer require the treatment as the Western Blot had come back as negative  and that I didn?t have Lyme and they were going to refer me to Immunology for further testing. I saw the immunologist several days later and several tests were run.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> After several appointments he basically said he couldn?t do much else and that if I did get sick again to come back to this hospital and check in as his patient. Which I did when I fell sick in August that year (2008) this time not as many test were run and my frustration made me discharge from hospital before I was feeling better.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The frustration was caused by the doctor giving a possible diagnosis of Migraine. I was shocked  disgusted  annoyed  revolted and every other terrible feeling known to man ran through me...was this guy for real!! As if after all these years and all these tests and all this pain and the extent of the symptoms I had suffered...As if I was suffering from Migraines!!!  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Now it comes to March 2009 once again last Sunday I started feeling the same pain as I do everytime I have an ?episode? then the hot/cold sweats so I called the specialist I saw in August who suspected migraines (I had no one else to turn to) he insisted I attend his clinic the next morning at the hospital. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The next morning after looking me over they sent me for the usual blood tests  I asked them to test for Lyme again. I went home and by my follow up appointment with the doc on Thursday morning the pain had got worse  I began to feel nausea and I?d started vomiting.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ???? The tests had come back and the Lyme serology was still positive using the ELISA. ???? <br/>  <br/>  <br/> They increased my painkillers as the others weren?t cutting it and said if I got worse to come back to hospital so they could treat my symptoms better.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> By 10:30pm that night my eyes had become sensitive to light and my ears the same to noise  the pain was unbearable and the tramadol & the oxycontin & the endone weren?t helping. So back into hospital I went. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> On Friday night they gave me my 15th lumbar puncture although they said I would never have to have another ever again they thought it may help to work out ?What was wrong with me?. That brings me to today still in pain  lying in my hospital bed  dictating this posting to my wonderful Mum. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Between my ?episodes? I have never been 100% healthy since my first one back in 2001/2002 I get headaches  twitches in my face  depressed for no reason  have difficulty concentrating  forget important things  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> (I use to pride myself on my memory)  get hot/cold sweats  unexplained pains for several hours  insane headaches  swollen glands all the time for no specific reason (cold/flu etc)   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> sleep excessively some days and insomnia on others  my teeth will hurt for no reason  buzzing and ringing in my ears  my menstrual cycles have been crazily irregular sometimes 6mths then 2mths then 4mths etc  <br/>  <br/> hunger for air (feels like someone is sitting on my chest)  vomiting or nausea for no apparent reason and the list goes on. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> So that brings me to my question...I have tested positive twice for Lyme Serology using an ELISA.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I have tested negative (between those two tests) using the Western Blot I was receiving treatment at the time this test was taken. My doctors don?t believe I have Lyme Disease as it is a clinical diagnosis and they cannot be sure that is what I am suffering from.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> After reading this story can anyone let me know if my case sounds familiar? Do Lyme?s suffers get worse twice a year for periods between 4-24 days? If I do have Lyme then I must have contracted it in 2001 can it still be treated? How do I find a doctor willing to treat me or at least help me? <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I?m sick of being sick and extremely over being told that there is nothing wrong with me when there clearly is something very wrong. I just need something to FIGHT!! I will never get better until I name the enemy! I need to have something to fight against... <br/>  <br/>  <br/> I need to know what is wrong so I can stop feeling like it?s all in my head and know that I?m not going crazy.

4765.176645,yes,yes,882,82860,7,0,0,0,Hello. I was wondering if anyone else experiences this surrounding appointments with  <br/>  <br/> their doctor.  I have an appointment with a new doctor and I cannot stand the fear I feel around  <br/>  <br/> it. I have to go in and fight for my life. My life depends on it and I know it. For an hour  <br/>  <br/> you have to convince someone how ill you are and how compromised your life is and hope they  <br/>  <br/> believe and act appropriately. I do not like putting so much faith in any one person. The  <br/>  <br/> stress of one appointment defining my life takes my breath away. There is much fear and urgency.  <br/>  <br/> I am a very seasoned Lyme patient  but the fear gets worse and worse. What am I afraid of  <br/>  <br/> exactly? What everyone is afraid of- that you will not be taken seriously and you will lose  <br/>  <br/> your life. Thank you for your time.,4,8,0.096969697,Training,Training

I have never recalled a bite and have never noticed a rash. I live in Southern California which I don't think had alot of lyme.

4830.129754,yes,yes,758,49356,30,0,0,0,My Lyme  which I've probably had for a long time  was triggered by the Gardasil vaccine (HPV vaccine).   <br/>  <br/> Has anyone else here discovered their Lyme through a flare up after receiving a vaccine? <br/>  <br/> My LLMD says its quite common because the vaccine triggers the immune system to perform at a higher level  which then causes the immune system to be able to  see  the Lyme  which had previously hidden from it.  So then the immune system goes into attack mode  but since our immune system alone isn't enough to kill of Lyme  it stays at a constant higher level... and keeps trying to kill the Lyme.. which attests for many of the symptoms. <br/>  <br/> Just wondering if anyone else out there has discovered their Lyme through a vaccine...,31,18,0.045112782,Training,Training

4874.270684,yes,yes,1602,22189,2,0,0,0,Hi all  I'm to this and some would say that I'm making myself nuts over what might be nothing.  But the more I read  the more nervous I get.....We found a tick on my almost 3 year old on Monday.  I know it had been there since over the weekend because we were riding in the car and he asked about something on the back of his neck- I ran my fingers over it and felt a small bump and thought it was a bug bite and thought nothing of it.  Then on Monday found the tick in the same spot---and I'm feeling like a big schmuck about that.   <br/>  <br/> Anyway  the ped removed it on Monday but they don't send them for testing here (hindsight I wish I had saved it and found somewhere to send it myself).  They told us he was too little for the typical medication and so gave him a single dose of amoxicillian (that's weird right??) and gave us the checklist of symptoms to watch for.   <br/>  <br/> I'm totally freaked out  nervous that he's infected and won't develop the rash and we won't realize he's sick.  And nervous that even it we do catch it quickly he'll be one of the few that the early treatments don't work for...and on and on.   <br/>  <br/> Okay  this is quickly turning into a therapy session.  Basically  I'm wondering if we should see someone who knows more about Lyme and get him on some sort of treatment plan now.  I'm not a fan of over use of antibiotics but at the same time  I really just want to head this off at the pass.  And for what it's worth  I won't be offended by answers telling me that I'm a worrywart lunactic and need to chill out for a few weeks and wait and see.  TIA,9,43,0.019292605,Training,Training

Lyme has destroyed all the cartilage in both wrists  knees  right elbow and shoulder and some of left ankle. I just turned 29. <br/>  <br/> ========================================== <br/>  <br/> For the past several nights I have been very sick: <br/>  <br/> Migranes ( which I never get ) <br/>  <br/> Night sweats ( rarely get ) <br/>  <br/> Increased pain to the point where I couldn't get out of bed  lift the covers off or hold a cup <br/> ( this is with lots of pain medication in my system) <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Last night I noticed a mark on my hand that looks EXACTLY  like the mark I had in '97 only smaller.

Didn't seem <br/>  <br/> to have any problems until November.  My right  <br/>  <br/> arm went numb and then three weeks later visual <br/>  <br/> disturbances.  MRI showed a single lesion on my <br/>  <br/> spinal cord.  Neuro said that it currently does  <br/>  <br/> not fit the profile for MS so I am on watch for  <br/>  <br/> MS.  I was never tested for Lyme Disease.  My arm <br/>  <br/> is not quite as numb as it was and my vision  <br/>  <br/> better.  I guess my question is... Do these  <br/>  <br/> symptoms seem like those  <br/>  <br/> that should be tested for Lyme?  It was four  <br/>  <br/> months before I showed any symptoms.

I'm hoping someone can shed some light on what I'm going through and allay (or confirm) my concerns. <br/>  <br/> Last Monday (6/15) I started treatment for suspected Lyme with 300mg of Omnicef twice a day.  That night  I got home from work with a fever of 102  a lot of muscle pain  and soreness. <br/>  <br/> Over the next four days  I continued to have a fever usually between 99.5 and 100.5  developed a cough  sore throat  night sweats  and headaches (none of these are symptoms that I had experienced previously). <br/>  <br/> On Friday  I talked to the doctor and she told me to stop taking the Omnicef and see if the temperature went down. <br/>  <br/> By yesterday  all the symptoms were still there and I went to see her.  She said it was probably a herx  got blood to send to Igenex for Babesia testing  and told me to order Chlorella and Burbur and that the fever should go away in the next few days. <br/>  <br/> Today  it's still here and I'm getting really worried.  Would a herx still be going 4 days after I stopped taking the medicine??  Is there anything else obvious I should be thinking of?  I don't think fevers are supposed to last 10 days. <br/>  <br/> Thanks!,3,15,0.055045872,Training,Training
